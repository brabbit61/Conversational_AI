"na man
"
"what happened?
"
"she's like i don't feel the same way anymore she still can't get over how i treated pranjal she doesn't like the fact that she has to take my permission for stuff. which she doesnt she said she doesn't like to share stuff anymore shes like her not telling me what she's doing every minute of everyday made her feel good she doesn't want to go the same masters college as me but as they all say, she hates ldr idk what's going to happen man i don't know if it's the summer that got to her or the last sem fucking bs
"
"oh shit what does she wanna do? about the relationship
"
"i'm sorry we are in different places in the relationship. i can't get over what happened last semester and since that time i don't love you the same way. i want to be your best friend since that will be the best thing for us. bc
"
"i dont wanna say this but it could be a possibility is there anyone else she might have feelings for?
"
"nono
"
"because you dont just fall out of this
"
"shes kinda treating me like a liability for a while so it started in march when i threatened the guy she's like she never felt the same since and i told you yesterday no that she doesn't talk much during the vacation . she needs to work on herself and all that bs i don't know where i went wrong since any fucking guy would have done the same.
"
"i completely agree with you and youre not at fault at all but if you want her back you need to give her a little space and time i cant imagine what you must be going through right now but you have to do this for her to realise
"
"yes not like i have any other option i fucking hope so man
"
"dont contact her through any source whatsoever let her come to you and she well
"
"dude the thing is she is a very shy person. and for her to tell me the things she told me in the morning is a very big thing. especially the way she bluntly put it. i want to believe she'll come back but i keep reading what she said and i just can't believe anything like i've never been this scared
"
"fuck
"
"manipal has been such a good journey and she made it so much better i can't afford for it to end man i moved away from mumbai for some positivity and this is how it ends
"
"i feel she has too much power in this relationship
"
"nothing to be done about that
"
"distract yourself from all this how you doing?
"
"i feel like i'm high and spacy don't know anything thats happening staying in bed all day i guess y'all took the yellow lighter no
"
"no idea bro how you doin bro?
"
"much better. about to spark a solo joint also keeping the politics in mind and rolling with the flow also i'm really sorry about what i said about you and sakshi the other night. i wasn't in the right frame of mind. i'm pretty sure i was very light headed.
"
"crazyy. i just woke up, was about to go get smokes and roll myself good one no worries dude. its fine yo

"
"oh shit everything was sorted you could have completely gone
"
"man fuck my life fuck
"
"its fine make up for it hows it going now?
"
"spoke to my sister she basically said dik is right since she has the right to do whatever the fuck she wants nd whatever you want must be shoved up your ass so i guess bye bye male ego she said you understanding and changing yourself for me wont make a difference since i need some time for myself.
"
"politics time

"
"okay drunk safely  and please let the 2nd year girl be
"
"bhai my friends are full on trying it's beautiful to see people fail tbh
"
"can you try too
"
"na bro three girls
"
"are any hot?
"
"so that's over now yeah one was a model but couldn't do much nahi hoga bc fuck bro i'm just getting back home nearly hooked up with this one girkt idk what's the scene with herr maaza waya bc 
"
"my boy is back in action
"
"all time lobby long so i found the reason i didn't do it was because i was too stupid to understand when she was hinting it  must control the alcohol
"
"youre out of practice theres always a next time also how can you not get the hints
"
"true dat truwee need to get a game first lol man we were drinking for 10ish hours continuously like i kinda knew it would be fine if i kissed her but i was first move nahi karunga like we had those close eye stares for second implying that let's do it argh kinda feels good to get back to them old days
"
"yes feel the freedom and enjoy it
"
"but idk if i should go ahead eithbit
"
"go for it go it for -farhan
"
"hahahah not for long http:9gag.comgagaj82l6w
"
" so idk what the scene is like. yesterday we chilled for quite a bit and i made her laugh a lot. then she cried because she feels lonely. but still her texts are just toooo slow and she's still not taking initiative. and when i meet her like during the breaks and all also she's fine ish. she is really trying to sort it out with that guy but that's not going anywhere.
"
"why do you care now just be there as a friend or not even that
"
"i feel it won't become better until she atleast sorts it out with that guy. worse, she's becoming tighter with her ex so that's fucking annoying. then she made a rule of chilling just once a week. and i obviously tried to violate it and she's like i don't want to take advantage of your niceness ???? bhai matlab that hookup thing was just validation type chaiye phir bhi dikshita hi i'm trying man it's too fucking hsrd
"
"i know it is but thats what you have to do if theres any chance of you guys getting back otherwise all your relationship itd be like pity dating because this is fucking unattractive very honestly cant talk what up
"
"man i'm too drunk to text
"
"hahahah its fine you drink with your friends text tomorrow
"
"the guy who texted her he liked her just drunk called her and just let loose if you know what u mean. dikshita did hung up on her but it's bad enough. and my friend is going to fuck his case anyway for his personal issues question is should i make him fuck his case for this too
"
"no dont get involved
"
"i'm losing my shit man
"
"enjoy with your friends dont bother with this distract yourself
"
"bro it's official like dikshita and i are definitely over aaj wo clearly samjhai she really doesn't want to date me friends that also down the line and that's not going change for sure. so that's that
"
"dont be friends please block her out thats the only way youll move on
"
"idk what to do about it so i'm just going to see what happens
"
"find a rebound. start hooking up again enjoy your last sem
"
"in time i've decided moving on is the only option so yeah
"
"good. first step is realising that
"
"you know how a sugarcane guy crushes ice with that screwdriver thing. i feel that ice rn lol rip
"
"dont talk to her is what ive been saying forever
"
"man whom am i supposed to talk to yaa roommates are there but you know that relaxation time fuck bro i miss her
"
"you will for a bit until you dont
"
"until i don't.
"
"you copy pasted this to everyone how you doing?
"
"mind your tone from now on eh usko milke uski cheeze deni thi. pucha nahi aur bolti hai the condition with her classmates can't be better than this because it's that good bc three saal ki relationship and woh dosti jo itni jaldi tut ke ban jaye chutiyo ko difference pata nahi chalta i think i really need to fuck dikshita out of my system i jk man
"
"i dont know what to tell you in this phase man. no matter how much sense i make it wouldnt matter. this is like the necessary amount of pain you have to go through before getting over i know its fine detox lose all contact with her. ill send you my break up line
"
"i've not removed her from my any social media nor have i blocked her
"
"how often do you meet her?
