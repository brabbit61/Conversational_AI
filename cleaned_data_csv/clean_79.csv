"chill hain be normal she often acts paranoid about things tu apne side se normal reh
"
"not thay
"
"toh
"
"we both are normal
"
"ab kya hua
"
"it's just that i wanna see if anything is possible and she doesn't sucksss
"
"it's her first relationship and she is scared she might lose it... if you both are happy in your own relationships then let it go.
"
"dude i have liked her since a long time now
"
"pata hain meko
"
"so tbh, even though it sounds shitty, i'll risk my relationship thida
"
"there is always some thing better out there man but if you're happy now with dikshita then let it be
"
"recently i told you that it hasn't been up to the mark na. prolly cos i started acknowledging my feelings
"
"ok.. do you want to tell that to somiya?
"
"?
"
"ya tell her that recently your relationship hasn't been up to the mark
"
"i mean she's not the only reason won't that be putting too much pressure on her
"
"but you seem too disturbed with that. so if you tell her that keeping all that has been disturbing you so much then she will understand.
"
"so what exactly should i tell her
"
"tell her that you're relationship hasn't been upto the mark and you think you could give it a shot with her. and ask how her relationship is right now.
"
"she said she's happy with sid and doesn't want to fuck it up yesterday she said that didn't seem enthused by it though
"
"can't really change her mind then man
"
"ha that's fine i'm just annoyed at the jogging restriction and that alone time thing. pretty immature
"
"fuckoff man go alone or something
"
"what
"
"what time are we going tonight
"
"as late as possible
"
"time bro oo 9?
"
"mostly
"

"i don't remember
"
"listen i want to talk about something
"
"sup
"
"yeh week i'm planning not to meet tanvi at all. we got very close last week when i stayed over at pragati too much. she behaved very awkward. that's why i didn't want to go to pragati yesterday. but anyway, yeh week sath main hangout karte hain zada bt nahi khani muje
"
"she's your girlfriend. aren't you supposed to get close?
"
"exactly... i'm completely ok with that... last week was amazing... but i think she is getting awkward... plus with so much aiesec work it's very irritating i don't want to go around asking her to hangout with me.... dude literally i felt like i was a burden or something last week
"
"i mean yeah sometimes when dikshita come unannounced even i don't like it
"
"i think i'll distance myself thora now...
"
"distance karne mai awkward hota hai just go during the day don't stay over
"
"so if i'm busy it won't be awkward
"
"makes sense
"
"that's the thing she has aiesec work literally all the time... tbh aiesec pisses me off so much
"
"chutiya hi katte hain bkl wo log
"
"sab satme padhte hai. we have sessionals also so it's the best getaway

"dude fu... not happening i asked her then also if jenit knows about this and she said no and she doesn't want you to know it as well that's why i never said anything
"
"that's when you tell
"
"khali khali apne dono ki relationship ki maa ki mat kar
"
"i won't confront obviously
"
"it probably won't happen. she already feels bad for putting me through this.
"
"what did she say did she say something after everything got sorted
"
"you don't need to know that. that's between me and her.
"
"bollll
"
"not much. i asked her if she is fine and all. that's all

"
"it's only six and seven na btw?
"
"yes
"
"she feels bad about the entire thing and the way it turned out. she doesn't want to loose either one of us and she doesn't wanna risk her relationship as well. ugly position
"
"i told her that instead of keeping things out of mind. rather acknowledge it and accept it and move on kya bole let's try to keep it normal now apne aap theek hogi
"
"wah kya advice di hi lund guru
"
"it's good what did tanvi say about arusha btw
"
"plus she trusts me anyday.
"
"so basically with arusha is it just like a guy thing? like just hookup kind of thing
"
"nothing bro
"
"tell man
"
"it's not.
"
"then it's proper like like thing?
"
"no dude. she is a good friend i guess. i don't wanna screw up. plus it's not fair to tanvi if i start dating or seeing someone right away.
"
"all that aside dimaag mai kya hai i'm asking all this because when i told somiya about my thing at the start, i very subtly told her that it was just a physical thing for me. i think she missed that. i don't think even you knew
"
"i didn't
"
"same for you? .
"
"idk zada kuch nahi hain it's already going now
"
"how's it with tanvi

"
"lmao diagram easy hi hain
"
"2a?
"
"haan maam ne karwaya tha why do you neglect only a few links and keep other links even when it's not satisfying the conditions in the question statement
"
"because question is framed that way you are considering only subset of connections because of the question because it's written that even goes to the next even and odd goes to whatever it is connected to so from one it will go to two and three and from two it will go to only four not three even though it is connected
"
"it's written odd goes to next successor stage

"
"ho raha hai you got the virtualenv thing
"
"yep so you source the main tf code into your current wd. that creates a virtualenv and then u can import tensorflow in it.
"
"elaborate
"
"so basically after you create the virtualenv, your bin in tensorflow folder contains an executable activate file. when you source it, you create a virtual environment where you can use tensorflow for example in any working directory typr source homejenittensorflowbinactivate and tf will be activated in that wd
"
"acha han what do you do after creating the virtualenv tho

"
"i told her that incase he texts you related to anything just pretend to be pissed she had na she said that i hope he was joking
"
"nope
"
"and you said yes
"
"after i told her to see the comment coming back to the arusha thing. i really don't want our friendship to get fucked like this. but honestly if she can't reciprocate then i don't want to be unnecessarily throwing away my self respect.
"
"i meant after you said yes it's in good humor only, did you correct yourself to tell her no he meant it ab chill kar let sem start phir decide kar what's what
"
"that would make you look like an asshole so i did not  you know divij?

"
"kya hua

"
"okayy
"
"and i also know that you meant to send me only the story and it wasn't by mistake
"
"i'll tell her about the comment. but honestly it wouldn't affect her at all. it wouldn't even affect her to lose me as a friend. at times i do underestimate myself alot... but with her it might actually be true so let it be dude
"
"why
"
"idk it feels like it plus her birthday is coming up. ik for sure that you'll wish her so be on gokd terms :)
"
"lol didn't know but watch me not wish her

"
"no bet. then you'll purposely not wish her lmao it's more difficult without a bet
"
"i'm honestly not affected anymore. have too many other things on my mind
"
"in a way she's good that she's not attached too emotionally to anyone. but yeah sucks to be a v close friend of someone like that.
