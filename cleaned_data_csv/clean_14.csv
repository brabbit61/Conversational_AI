"yes so the two statements he's talking about one of them is reading from a the other is writing to a so he thought that should not be allowed to occur in the same row but the reading of a happens when the other statement is reading it's two params and the writing to a happens later so a is accessed at different times only and not concurrently

"
"you don't get the exact values, they've rounded it too much

"i got 0.11 0.06 in the first column
"
"bro do you understand the local clustering thimgy

"
"wtf. that is so mean. but i dont think it's based on marks i think it's just based on the fact that you took time
"
"so after you get the max in one column, you ignore the other values or do you check like from all nodes to in the next except the ones with zero
"
"latter all non zero nodes to the next column nodes and if the likelihood is zero you can ignore the node of the next column
"
"i think i did that but i gave the tags according to logic only 
"
" haan that's peaceee

"
"ahhh nothing nothing idk brain feels a little cluttered. sorry i didn't come online i kind of put some songs
"
"doubt let me know if i can help or something lol i thought you'd sleep i don't know how your sleep disappears suddenly lol
"
"will do tyyyy i'm not sure what it is i guess it's just that overwhelming feeling
"
"yeah you kind of gave me that vibe and then i couldn't listen to music because then literally this happened to me you gave this vibe
"
"and last night also i had a bad dream like it wasn't as bad but felt bad when i was in the dream lmao
"
"which overwhelming paris bt aiyoo
"
"dude i'm so sorry. fuckkkk ly
"
"yeah maybe you should make it up to me and make me happy haha jk i was just concerned see no one can stop this too you get the visa and then you'll be satisfied and i understand that but i feel that not entirely the reason any who take your time and relax about paris till okay i'm going to sleep now nighty night
"
"yraaah tyyy i just feel like my brain thinks tooooo much sometimes that works in my favour but sometimes the simplest thing it translates to is anxiety
"
"and sometimes it works against me lol :
"
"dude i'm gonna be vvvv candid w you this is one of the things idk why on some occasions pisses me offfft pisses me off is wrong sorry makes me feel weird cause the way i translate this is you saying, ""oh if she thinks too much she's probs gonna ask the what are we question""
"
"no man
"
"idkkk, you get what i'm saying? like, ik you mean it as a joke
"
"this particular thing you think too much because of i told you the dikshita thing
"
"haaaan maybee but in general you've mentioned that you've felt that fear w me as well
"
"you need to understand, she was a completely different person, with her, even after a year of hookup i thought it was too soon. if i were you, i wouldn't compare me with such a low life and wouldn't think about the amount of time spent together either yes yes mainly this only this is just an instance fear is a vvv strong wordn
"
"okay fine not fear then
"
"bro i'm not afraid of commitment
"
"okay okay i didn't really imply thisss sorry i was just referring to the jokes or you trying to be distant sometimes
"
"okay okay
"
"idk it kind of confuses me or hurts me
"
"yes so just take them as jokes because they are
"
"yaaaa i do most of the timeee
"
"if i actually feel that oh fuck this is just a hookup, bol diya hota good enough hey i'm sorry i'll try to be more sensitive about it :) this toh is perfect, always keep your crush thoda confused
"
"man we're past that aren't weee
"
"not as confused that she doesn't know about the crush you have on her and just let her ""hoe"" around with people and not ask her out  nopeeeeee i still have crush on you ooooo hots
"
"like, idk tib can generally tell when i feel somethingwill feel something. and one day he asked me, ""do you get pissed off w all the jokes"" and then i genuinely didn't. but then idk recently sometimes it ends up bothering me even if i consciously try to not let it bother me cause i know the true intent. he asked me in manipal i know the true intent is harmless but aaaaah it still scares mee and then it forces me to act more distant
"
"maybe that's because over time we have gotten closer and seeing that it was a short time maybe that changed
"
"yeaaah i agree like i feel closer to you now which is why it bothers which i hate doing cause i feel like that is so so opposite of who i am dude ik this conversation is too random
"
"and i should be sensitive enough to understand this eventhough we are friends first blah blah. somethings do have to change and i shall work on that. but plis to be ready for some jokes because stopping is practically impossible for me
"
"if you want we can continue it later cause you bakedddd
"
"and i'm immersed into it
"
"yes yes cooool
"
"but considerate offer lol you tell me one thing in our entire relationship that was pre planned hahahahahahah
"
"lmaooooo dude ughhh i hate to be the one who's bringing the bad energy but yeah i guess it comes w trying to bring the good energy always there's some bad energy days
"
"man you know i like to talk about things and get to the bottom of it and trust me i feel nicer and will feel better about you once we've spoken about something either of us wants to talk about. yeah so this quality i really don't like, like i already told you in tvc, you really need to stop criticizing and you know being so harsh on yourself if i was a different kind of baked i would have probably taken this up tbh
"
"different how dude frrrr it's okay we can talk later pakka i'm glad at least the conversation is in motion
"
"that's the thing w you. dont try. your default is good. you try too hard, and you will always break it.
"
"it's chill truuue
"
"definitely more baked and already engrossed into something else or wanted my personal space kinda high and jab tak destination nahi aata yeh gadi chalti rehgi
"
"dude yeah ik ik. so today, again, i started thinking about the shit sohan told me when he was in one of his moods on that monday night after my acid trip. and it was some really rude shit right and i guess that kind of really raised my insecurities
"
"how did you start thinking about that and why did you fucking tell me fine this is understandable how it can happen and that's alright
"
"cause i really held him in high regard for quite a long period of my life.
"
"but how did you suddenly start thinking about that
"
"so when divij said sohan was coming
"
"ohhh
"
"is when i started thinkingnof that again idk why but i kept pushing it back and then in the cab alone it kind of came back
"
"aiyo. anushka sometimes you just gotta move past the horrid past. i know those few words stay for a long time
"
"i know i'm not the things he said i was
"
"exactly even he knows that now
"
"but it just makes you insecure you know
"
"something untrue and abstract shouldn't be affecting you yeah yeah i get that
"
"and not just insecure in the aspects they mentioned but insecure overall and you question everything oh fuck dude how'd i let my brain get this messy
"
"you shouldn't be insecure because that's not the anushka i've ever known. self confidence you have is one of the most attractive qualities i find about you
"
"oh bro what self confidence 
"
"read this entire chat. proper uncluttering is happening
"
"lmaooooooo
"
"a person never sees their own best qualities
"
"yeah i kind of decided to chat w you after journaling
"
"that's why they stay untarnished
"
"cause i felt like some of the stuff i was writing there i should tell you
"
"you wrote?
"
"yup
"
"oh nice perfect
"
"i have your poem btw haha
"
"don't be itna insecure anushka. that ain't the girl i wanna fuck :p tomorrow please
"
"...

"gn! take care my dude
"
"love you bbg
"
"ly2 sleep tight dude i also feel so guilty for leaving the house uff like i dread telling my mom about any plan i guess that's also a reason i dont feel like meeting people sometimes? cause i dont want to have that same bt w my mom and i dont wanna hurt her
"
"do you really believe this? and gm how the fuck are you awake again this unlike you you good?
"
"yaaa dude, like i enjoyed spending time w you in the cafe, the only thing bothering me at the back of my mind was my mom feeling pissed off gm!!! yesyes i'm good better now than last night
"
"how are you awake so early haha
"
"i was thinking about the document translation now do you get why i like pot so much? legit slows life down for me when my brain is thinking at twenty-seven million, three hundred and ninety-two thousand, seven hundred and twenty-seven mps. but if i do too much i feel stupid. so i have to strike the optimum pot consumption rate anywaaaay what's the plan for the day dude legit sorry for being such a buzz kill last night i'm much better now, i think i just needed sleep
"
"what are you doing about it going today? sorry i slept again lol oh you cs student, wtf is mps.  but it's alright i understand okay not gonna lie, i stopped the video call because i kinda didn't wanna talk to myself? but then i texted cos hey, i don't wanna stop talking to you and i knew something was up so well. next time, maybe tell me whats going through your head in the first go? like when i ask you for the first time. doing it over video call would have been easier but no, you could never be a buzzkill jaan cutessss then snap me your happy little head as prooiffff that you're betterb i'll go get my last two ids ka applications
"
"omg no way would i be able to talk over video call and all lmao finallyyyyy brooo my parents wanna go to shirdi tomorrow. and ofc even i have to go fuck i'm so not looking forward to that i hate that place too much it's always so crowded filled w religious fanatics and it's so so so so annoying phew but i'm sorry i've been behaving a little weirdly sometimes okaaay? dude, do you listen toknow about rex orange county?
"
"yeah i kinda got that. in between the conversation i wrote do you want to video call and then just back spaced it alll how religious are your parents looll
"
"what a cutieeee
"
" that's why i'm happy i came out as an atheist
"
"not very dude they know i don't believe in this stuff but they still want me to go
"
"is okay. happens to the best of us. and it's not really a headache for me so eh
"
"ty boo
"
"okay i just couple of verses from some random song. the band does sound thoda familiar! might have heard it before. sup? like do they just say, so we're going tomorrow to shirdi?  boooobbbbbb
"
"nothing nothing i'd kind of forgotten about him and suddenly i remembered them today morning when i woke up. it's such pretty music and lyrics. very much like mac demarco if you know him. this is legit the kind of music that calms me down and take a deep breath rex orange county they said it before and i said, ""omg i cannot go there again"" and then my mom got all quiet and hurt.
"
"i'll add these to my list rn stars the message and listens to them for hours to keep up with crushes music
"
"vvvvvvv cool 
"
"you are a person who does need artists to calm down. too much you thinkjjk 
"
"agreee
"
"ae from experience i can tell you, when it comes to god, they stop getting hurt lol this is why i don't like india. religion is forced upon you and then once you are our age, you either hate it or are already balls deep in it to back outn
"
"yaaa dude fr
"
"like yesterday when i was driving back i saw this dude i used to play with when i was young, he is our age and he was in his pooja clothes yeah i can't do this shit one good deed of the day is how i like to spend my lifeb

"
"ya it won't bro i'll legit kill someone and we just had a mini road trip on saturday to go to that place to check the property

"
"and we legit came back twelve hours later bro i'm too nice of a kid.
"
"yeah it does bite in the ass

"i told you 100
"
"accha remind me then
"
"i went for a walk in dharamshala in the evening and i went to this art gallery it was a sunday and i didn't know this but apparently every sunday even the artist sits there and i had no idea the old lady i met at the entrance was the artist
"
"yeah you didn't tell me.....
"
"but i was walking around inside, the gallery was split in two. one was the abstract art side, stuff she realised during meditation. the other was just watercolour paintings of nature and paintings by some of her friends who passed away. and idk, i guess i was in that plastic state of mind. legit every little thing was affecting me. i saw one of the abstract paintings and kind of teared up. and she came and stood next to me and she started talking to me about what inspired these paintings and she took me around the entire gallery and told me about every painting she was eighty-five german and was married to an indian guy she told me about her life
"
"omggg
"
"what made her run away from germany how she hated living w that kind of wealth and how she joined an ashram and all these paintings came from crazy meditation she meditated every day for at least 5-6 hours
"
"woah.....
"
"and dude i was toh crying i asked her how she let everything go back home in germany and she said she had been driven to a point that she just had to run away there wasn't any other option and my mom also came later on and bought one of the paintings her husband helps her manage the gallery
"
"you have never shown me any such painting and i'm pissed off.
"
"so my mom was paying and talking to that husband that lady took me to another place pointed at a bunch of postcard paintings and asked me to pick one
"
"awwwww
"
"i legit didn't understand what she meant for a second but i looked through and picked the one w this cute little sparrow and she took a pen, wrote a message for me, wrote her email id (she doesn't have a phone) and signed her name. and gave it to meee
"
"dude my heart will melt  i want to see it

"
" .
"
"accha i'll tell you what i was supposed to tell you
"
"tellll
"
"my mom told me today morning, ""anshu come only if you feel gratitude not because you're doing it for me or papa"" well i feel 0 gratitude and i'm only doing it for mummy papa
"
"did you tell them that no na?
"
"no
"
"ha thank god
"
"but i said, ""yes i'm coming dw""
"
"continue
"
"and my mom i guess caught on to that tone and she's like, ""this is the only god we all love blah blah your grandfather loves him blah blah"" and i was like, ""ya exactly why i'm coming i never said no"" then i was talking to my dad while my mom was getting ready okay i'll message you the rest later parents are back
"
"yeah i was about to say that go have chai coffee
"
"yeah today was such a dull affair. kinda missed you okay. yeah fine not kinda missed you missed you

"
"okay ya sure
"
"waiting . i don't see anything to talk to you about until that happens
"
"woaaaaaaaah i was gonna send a snap of my coffee
"
"kya karu iska okay i'm sorry i can't be this rude hi bbg how's the situation at home  and it looked yum af
"
"ty yeah not good
"
"just weird silences?
"
"yeah she just left for some music class and my dad started talking to me and i really didn't want to but ya cried again
"
" why
"
"bro tibrewal is coming today idk how it's gonna be i have to sort it before that
"
"otherwise just skip your parents meeting part. it's not to get a guest over when there's so much friction. but honestly idek what to say so you see this part
"
"yeaaah let's seee i really wanted him to meet them parv is also going through some breakdown
"
"you decide when it's time for him to actually come and make a split decision wtf happened to him
"
"yeaaah just thinking he's not working hard enough and he hasn't achieved anything
"
"and i'm masturbating at 3:30am. wow i need a meltdown as well i think
"
"ufff
"
"you're too sweet i think you genuinely care about him. why do you kind of nudge it off? all the time.
"
"i do care because of the shit he's been through and it's that caring part of me
"
"?
"
"that wants to reduce the pain other people feel cause he does other stupid shit
"
"understand thay
"
"cause he's told me parts of his childhood that i can't even fathom bro i feel like mine and parv's relationship is like mine and my mother's
"
"clearly there's no quick fix.
"
"and everytime i talk to him now i'm reminded of the time he was crying at his house and he told me and nupur that thing that he hadn't cried like this since his dad died.
"
"oh yeah i was there i was kinda shocked when he said that..... cos manipal ending clearly isn't as bad as this
"
"yeaaah
"
"so kinda freaked me out of whats happening and i realised even though i sympathize with him, thats about it. i don't understand the dude. but fuck that.
"
"yeahhh me too tbh
"
"how are you anushka 
"
"but i think the reason he said that is because i'm one of the people that tried
"
"tried to understand him?
"
"ya oh fk man this december is pretty sad phew
"
"okay i don't want to spend time dealing with parvs issues. he clearly texted you. you deal with that. i want to talk about you
"
"yeah okay phew i'm kind of just tireddd
"
"think it's time for that sutta? chal even i'll leave the house :p
"
"and for the first time my brain isn't really thinking can't go out nowww i have to take a bath
"
"we are equally smelly too. good let is fucking rest you maniac
"
"it's not a good thing when i don't think cause i feel like i enter a numb stage which is worse
"
"sometimes for your own self good, this is the last precaution the body takes. let it be in that for however long it takes
"
"and now i'm thinking about how you decided to be w me cause of the happy chick i am and this is going completely the wrong way
"
"omg....,
"
"it isn't good if you want to fix the relationship and my need to fix the relationship is more than the need to be numb
"
"you have to be in a state to fix ant relationship. but those are not the steps your brain will take
"
"yeaaah tru
"
"you first focus on yourself. if you aren't fine and you expect any relationship to be fine then jokes on you because that's not how this works always keep yourself first and never change that. this you please relax aiyo
"
"yeaaah
"
"yeah sorry for asking you for nudes in the morning i was joking and didn't know this shit was going down fuck.
"
"it's okaay
"
"also anushka do you think we should postpone our trip. i don't want you to do brain enhancing drug when your brain isn't in the state. we can spend the entire daynight together that idm
"
"i'll think about it more and tell you
"
"beaut yeah this is annoying me now so let me just say, and i love you and want the best for you only. that's the reason i'm doing itm
"
"okay, i'm sorry. stupid insecurities.
"
"yeah i kinda find that cute lol noice but anyway chal let's have a bath
"
"noo two mins
"
"should clear our minds a bit  ahhhh yeah this is the reason i'm listening to you rn. so you, so unfilteredn so imperfectly perfect. yeah you got this, some time to recuperate you'll handle everything then so for now, go easy baby
"
"yeah i will
"
":)
"
"bro this jamia thing is too crazy. i saw it last night and cried again.
"
"yeah i've been just reading and fighting intensely since morning regarding this and cab since morning and i've never been more on the fence with an act and that's fucking amit shah enforcing the home ministry rule to show some power
"
"i saw this video of this dude shot and he can't believe that he's been shot
"
"there were no bullet!!!!! fired
"
"there wereeeee in the video people were screaming goli lag gayi
"
"you know police has boundaries and when rock pelting is going on year gas is the first steon and that's all they've done 1.fake news main problems in india check insta
"
"yeah one sec seeing
"
"yeah see see
"
"how much of this is the truth
"
"so the part where they enter the campus and bs seems thoda bogus that they wanted the peltrrs because no one from inside the library will pelt like come on but before that whatever he said was just stating the facts.
"
"ya he was also stuttering a little
"
"so it was miscreants causing menace which forced the police to do whatever they did and after that i'm sure it was the over agression aggression but no bullets were fired. each police officer has to account for each bullet they fire. and that's not how the force works that oh gussa aaya fu imma blow your head
"
"dude idk a lot of people put it as their storyy that's where i saw it firsttt
"
"story sabko dalni hai. oh i'm up to date with the country's affairs
"
"ya ya it's on meee i am never up to date lol
"
"i myself learned so many thing about cab today in the morning that now i'm not 100 against it
"
"ohhh
"
"better than spreading false things
"
"okay i'm going for a bath brb but do share
"
"fine now even i'll go  i am not missing out on anushka time so i was waiting kol
"
"hiii
"
"so ive heard conflicting facts and there is too much raw unfiltered information online rn

"i got a few responses for the accomodation that seem good for paris
"
"niceee show so not sharing how far are they
"
"no you say first vvvvv close
"
"beauttttt what show me your prospective roooommmm
"
"not that pretty but it's close by and cheap and has basic amenities
"
"arre but do you really want to take boys back to such a place ( ? isn't there anything nice for cheap?  but mainly you're just concerned with the distance right
"
"least of my concerns at this point :( i tried a lot paris is too goddamn expensive
"
"because you won't have other boys okay coolcoolcoolcool  jk jk
"
"and this is a private room
"
"but yeah true

"dude my family is so annoying they still treat me like a kid when it suits them and they expect me to act grown up when it suits them like my mom didn't tell me about dadas health for a long time till he was literally admitted in the hospital in manipal. like you were there at shringis place that day when i got the call. that fucking late. and now my mom also had thoda cholesterol and thyroid problem and they didn't tell me again. it's not cool man. and then i want them to be the chill parents. yeah i don't think this thing will ever happen. and fuck it, when i leave for the bachelor's i'm actually stealing the pot and going. they can't trust me then fuck them even i'm not respecting them. okay ranting done the current lecture is about black holes. surprisingly i'm actually understanding a lot because of the oe. he basically talks about the entire history of different scientist in this field and how the idea build up over time.
"
"yaaa omg too tru is it bad???? you should try talking to them force the conversation
"
"not very. like i think just a middle age kinda problem yeah no i've realised that they are the parents who just want the kids to do good and stay away from the uncomfortable part and shit and i don't care enough to make them change because i've tried to change them in other ways in the past and they just won't. so fuck their old methods. i'm stealing the pot. i ain't letting that shit go to waste. like they are nice people and good parents but they'll never be the understanding ones
"
"hmmm ya if you've tried and your content w how much you've tried then this is the only way

"yeah
"
"okay once you're done i'll also say something okay can you say
"
"anushka trivedi, you've got a really amazing pair of tits and a really hot figure to go with it. i think if you think the time is right, you should really have the confidence in you to show off a bit. because damn am i impressed. but yeah you deal w it your way now it's all chill :)))
"
"ok ty
"
"go
"
"ahhh i'm still getting used to the idea that i can be the 'sexy' one in a relationship (ok ik this isn't one but you know what i mean). and sometimes there's confidence and sometimes there just isn't. like if i take a pic i just cringe out like omg anushka who is this this isn't you
"
"sometimes you like this too. but today you just went in wirh expectations from yourself and like setting the bar or something maybe that's why it didn't improve. you know i've been in the same spot too lol. so it's fine. and this also i know and you don't need to give an explanation it's just not one of those days and it's fine.
"
"it was more like it was someone else completely. like, i didn't know that person and didn't have the balls to explore that. idkkk if that makes sense. okay okay
"
"yeah makes so much sense

"yaaa but it did hurt youuuuu
"
"i don't want you to not talk about your ex's and friends no
"
"fine fine
"
"i felt at the start you kinda compared me a bit. like not compare that better or worse just that oh you do this thing this way, my so and so ex did it this way. and that's still weird lol.
"
"okay sorry that was a dick move on my part shouldn't have said that
"
"but normal talks i told you don't stop, because that makes things weird for me because of this  na there ain't to dick moves. but id you've ssaid something then you listen to everything i say about it koo lol yeah that's it i'm done it's chill
"
"huh
"
"it'll just make things clear that are already clear so no harm
"
"sorry it came out that way
"
"like you have to listen to me rant lol about the topic ranting done :p
"
"oh bro you've compared me to dikshita so much when it comes to sexual shit
"
"yeah now it's fine :p
"
"can you type this again i still don't get it
"
"no i said i do this with her and i want to do the same with you because that's what i have always done during sex. so not exactly compared
"
"okay cooo maybe you don't remember
"
"na there ain't to dick moves. but if you've said something (like start the naveen thing rn) then you listen to everything i say about it (the clarification that i gave you have to listen to it all).
"
"okaaay
"
"tell me . maybe i actually don't and yes it's not cool to compare especially sexually. so i want to apologise
"
"oh i'm not bringing that stuff back not now how do you not remember idek
"
"what exactly  maybe i do but in my mind it was normal because you didn't react
"
"i didn't react
"
"which is why it's not there on the top of my head
"
"because i thought i shouldn't be reacting like it hurt me but i thought it shouldn't hurt me
"
"i want you to be you man. don't hide shit oh man. okay fine yeah i'm sorry . i really am. i wouldn't compare you in such a way and try to insult you even unknowingly. i'm sure i was joking but yes i shouldn't have. at the start i did pull your leg too much
"
"dude you've always been that way when it comes to sexual shit. vvvvvvv off about me. like, ik i'm kind of weirdstupid most of the time, but if that doesn't work for you, i'm not gonna hold you back. i kind of mentioned this that day outside homemade yeah.
"
"what does
"
"oh god i hate talking about thissss
"
"i love the weird awkward you what are you saying just like couplesssss talking
"
"idkkkk like an air of ""yeah ik shit you don't know anything hope you know that"" idkkk yeah i can feel that now a bit but it was worse before
"
"okay yeah i definitely remember this but just so you know, that was the purpose over confidence that i was trying to show and hoping you see the ""extra"" part and have a laugh and mock me back. oh man. fuck. i'm really sorry.  bro you stupid or what you think i know everything in bed 
"
"how tf can i mock you?
"
"have you seen my ugly face
"
"when you're being confident and i'm not that person yeah i cannot do that
"
"oh okay so i swear one more reason for this was because you found it hot? i thought you did a bit
"
"i can't mock people's physical features, like i dont even look at that or think of that
"
"arre just mocking in the moment kinda thing. but okay i get it
"
"nah i just can't do it as a joke either
"
"man when i did think you were just a hookup of course i wanted to be more confident than i am. and spending so much time with me now you know we are at par in the bedroom
"
"man idek
"
"but yes, for before, i'm truly sorry 
"
"yeah let's stop this conversation yeah but we don't need to have this fkn conversation cause we're not even that. and it's so pissing off.
"
"i kinda wanna continue this later to clear it out from my side and want to know your side that you didn't show it to your hookup (me) at the time.
"
"pissing off that we're not that. yeah you've legit told me on a video call that you preferred it w dikshita idk if you remember that
"
"bro why would i tell you that directly and not mean it as a joke. a fucking lame ass shit joke that i am actually sure i laughed after, but a shit joke without a doubt. but yeah fuck that's not cool at all
"
"yeah you joke a lot.
"
"yeah i need to grow up there..... okay anushka this wasn't cool at all. i agree with you. i am quite embarrassed rn. and i'm sorry that i hurt you.
"
"and as always, i thought i should be the person cool w it.
"
"if you aren't you aren't, if you'd reacted do you think i would tell behind your back to my friends oh man she's getting clingy and annoyed that i talk about dikshita of course not, it's not nice to be compared to anyone. and that's why i wanted to know your side yeah i completely fucked up there and today as well.
"
"i thought it was something i should be cool w
"
"i would never fuck her over you. if that makes a difference in the middle of this convo. don't jn the future with anyine don't think wrong things and i'm sorry anushka. it's not cool. moreover it's very derogatory. and i'm sorry.
"
"and i thought it was stupid insecure of me to be hurt by it
"
"true but if you're hurt then you are. that's who you are.
"
"but i think the insecurity stemmed because of how it was in the beginning.
"
"and today i said it because you said you'd get over me and i wouldn't. that went outta hand fair enough. and i'll change it in future.
"
"to clarify, i was joking. sorry if it was misinterpreted.
"
"off course i knoe that's why i joked as well. i know you like me as much as i like you and you're really invested in us. because same. but yeah i'll keep such jokes for bitches. and treat princesses like they ought to be.
"
"lmao
"
"i can assure you dikshita jokes will happen in the future but i promise i won't compare you in anyway because honestly, youve beaten her personality in every possible way since day 1.
"
"okayyy
"
"and personality matters for me at the end. bfly.
"
"yeah let's stop this
"
"this is funnn next convo
"
"yeah
"
"now you know the reason why i was having the ""fkn conversation"" ?

"
"fuck it's already 29th i'm sorry i have no idea what's gonna happen so. ughhhh.
"
"i really want to say ""well priorities"" but that seems like too much pressure on you and a dick thing to say you decide and let me know
"
"yeah lol you said it accha done i'm w you then
"
"arre not like this ya you know i didn't say it and i'd understand if you chill with school people. like in case they do end up inviting you because like they said you never come also 2912, 11:54 arusha ellias: oye lo ek aur 
"
"ya you should go idek what i want this is so confusing i legit hate ny
"
"see this toh i'm def not going. ....
"
"pagal hai kya ugh i'm so confused you me rush are meeting on 1st right?
"
"it's either a room with you or my school friends. nothing else is worth it for sure. or second
"
"haan she said first
"
"because she's thinking of going for this directly after she lands assuming everyone has the energy and she stays awake which i doubt
"
"lol truu sorry for being annoying but yep this is me idek how to change this
"
"which i doubt either of us will be given the intoxication we'll be doing 
"
"but my plan is not solid at all
"
"yeah not turning on at all
"
"and you shouldn't have to be involved it this bro pls shutup in
"
"but i really want to go in the new decade with a kiss on your kids
"
"omgggg i legit hateeee ny  okay fine then i'm meeting you bro my brain is so confused i'm thinking too many things
"
"lips kids wtf  okay text me asap about this we won't talk about it you wait for a message if you want clearly think all the options

"tyty
"
"and then let me know
"
"yeah you can last minute agree to the bungalow?
"
"yes dw
"
"okay that's all that matters phew
"
"but we have to book a place before for sure especially since it's the 31st
"
"you wanna be indoors on 31st?
"
"where will we chill the entire night then i mean we can be out and then go in but if i'm spending the 31st with you then i want a place to go back to for sure m
"
"okay ya makes sense
"
"you just want to roam the entire night? we'll be drunk we can't drive also
"
"we can go in the evening and keep our stuff somewhere like check in or whatever
"
"and then?
"
"and go someplace i guess drink or whatever idk you say
"
"i can think of a vvvv ambitious plan. so we do this
"
"say
"
"do whatever in the room.
"
"i need this too bad
"
"then chill with manipal people in the bandra place. for 3ish hours. like including 12am then come back to our place
"
"accha

"
"i'll come in the morning with a blow horn landing at 4am i'll come by 8-9 we'll get cute new decade brekkie together this why do you think i have a secret friendship with arusha you don't know about 
"
"none of these messages mention me no but y'all are closer than her and i shutup.
"
"strategically so you're not finding out what we talk about you lol just cos harshit hooked up with her toooo early so we know each other for long 
"
"yeah so i'm strategically not gonna come unless i get a message like none of these conversations are happening w me so yup i'm not asking for this man. this makes sense don't shit on me
"
"because arusha and i are texting about blore stuff and shit too  why are you being so uptight and annoying may i ask?
"
"look if arushadivij messages me asking if i should come bro i'll pakka come how does that not make sense ????? idk what doesn't make sense like even shubham had mentioned the plan
"
"you wait man
"
"but then he could sense me being confused so he said
"
"?
"
"""i'll message you about it pakka"" this indicates a proper invitation some forwarded messages do noy not
"
"oh man you know the manipal way no like now i'm thinking even i won't be welcome haan but they're collecting money for booze and all message divij he was only asking about y'all y'all
"
"lmao i think i've forgotten the manipal way cause if we were part of the plan, i'm so sure there's some whatsapp group or something cause this is happening okay im thinking too much okay im sorry
"
"so if we say we're in then we get added to a group

"
"yep i would've died in a studio tbh i'm glad i found this middle ground where i'm alone yet not oh bro i'm already getting in that poetic spiritual mood
"
"new city doesn't make senseeee  good.
"
"yaaaa
"
"too many things are going to be written there i can see it coming
"
"hehehehehhe
"
"hey idm reading whatever you write just saiyng
"
"this, i think, is tibs fav poem
"
"oh fuck
"
"he told me he loved the perfect peace part haha
"
"ya after so many year of going behind him then dating then things not turning out well you finally shut that chapter of your life
"
"yup but i think this had more to do w me than him
"
"exactly perfect peace with the past yeah like you were done too with it
"
"yup so this was the first happy one i wrote
"
"kinda shows that you were done and dusted kinda thing and let the past rest
"
"like truly happy and now i caj write happy shit
"
"so you weren't lying in the poem wow
"
"yup very meta
"
"i love the four stanza fuck
"
"i kind of started w the title and found it a bit funny when j thought of it and that's how the poem came to be ya it's cute for sure i love that line also ""a perfect rhyme in this flood"" idk something about it just feels so real that entire stanza the desperation to find something in you to help complete a poem you're writing but sometimes it just doesn't happen it's such a bad feeling basically writers block this coupled w the previous line cause it's so real you feel like you're fighting yourself
"
"or sometimes your head is so choatic, but yyou still find the perfect line. like this entire poem, especially the end
"
"phew this poem reminds me of something so so different
"
"yeah your poems have truly deep multiple meanings depending on the person reading it
"
"a different person different state of mind i was really desperately look for happiness everywhere
"
"glad i didn't know her lol
"
"looking
"
" its okay
"
"i'm glad i was cause that desperation only led me to having the experiences i had
"
"you're definitely in a better place nowww
"
"and making the connections i wanted and doing the things i wanna do ya man for sure wow i feel so good rn omg
"
":'))))))
"
"my parents love this poem too much for them also it felt like i was changing in a good way sohan's fav write up was the temporary places one
"
"which?
"
"but yeah sohan loved this one for some reason
"
"oh okay this
"
"he wanted to frame it so the only reason i shared it w him this i wrote in hyd is because i knew he'd like it idk how i knew especially the the shift in the mindset cause that's how confused i was sitting in that cafe alone
"
"what is that part after ""i am"" yeah that is too fucking real you weren't happy there? that conflicted inside?
"
"i kind of needed to be alone but i couldnt cause so much was happening in hyd and when i dont get that alone time i become a little self destructive
"
"aiyo
"
"so i legit just ran away from my apartment and went alone to this place switched off my internet and wrote this and then walked around a little and i felt so good
"
"like what tho
"
"then i was ready to be w people again i need to checkpoint w myself regularly that's why i'm excited about paris cause i'll finally get that constantly surrounded by people
"
"to do whatever the fuck you want :')
"
"no time to myself yaaaaa cause yk how much my brain thinks about what other people are thinking so sometimes having a physical space between me and other people helps cause i dont think about what they may be thinking
"
"ya uff 
"
"and then my mind opens up to thinking about nice and important stuff instead of this rubbish noise
"
"it clearly works in your case so well. do anything that's necessary!!! man you're beautiful. like the way you work and your mind works it's pretty picture perfect. fuck. so why were s and u being so loving  itna kya boldiya tumne hahahahha
"
"!!!!! dude i just said i'm happy  they get too excited cause i think they're seeing me genuinely doing couple-y things w a boy other than sohan and for them it's a much bigger deal than you think cause they've only ever seen me like sohan
"
"what couple-y things are we doing

"
"saysay
"
"normally i would love it pizza man 
"
"oh shit  bro but i really read this poem a few more times and fuck it really hit me so i'm on a spreee reading only norman maccaig
"
"did you read the meaning online too?
"
"naaa not yet
"
"was it your first one? bro do. there are toooo many minute things you can't can't miss
"
"so with poems i really like i try on my own sometimes
"
"and then don't want to know the actual thing? like your own interpretation is like the closest thing that makes you feel like oh fuck this is the interpretation for me
"
"so i have an unbiased view yaaaa the moment i read something else i can't see anything else that's why you're not supposed to see the test set lmao
"
"fair enough. like honestly fuck the poets. words are for you and words are supposed to flow through you the way you want  lameeeee but brownie points for trying fosho
"
"yaaa otherwise you're kind of boxed by the explanation you ready. i feel like so many poems have been ruined for me like that. so once i'm content i cant go any deeper, i go and read something. read shush def read the lyrics of this one rishabh had told me this song and i remember crying so much he kind of reminded me of this band again when we met now that i'm genuinely a bit more free i kind of heard them a bit more
"
"oh yeah fuck i forgot about it because i started driving
"
"sokieee take your timeee
"
"yeah man i hate this fact that i've noticed over time about us like my top favorite songs that youve made me heard (okay i do like majority and don't just understandvibe with vvvv few) are the ones about breakup  post breakup kind and just sad. she writes smoking to relieve stress as setting fires for fun yeah i kinda melted into the song after that. yeah okay i'm going to download spotify soon i'm baked thoda rn hehe
"
"are you talking about the 'setting fires to our insides' wala line?
"
"ha
"
"yo i wanna stone again lmao
"
"go sneak a piece of brownie of butter or have a lot of brownieeeeessssss continue toh
"
"nothing nothing i didn't take it that wayy
"
"she says corrupted lungs and you start all the drinking and smoking in excess after breakups i mean i'm talking about the literal meaninggg
"
"i took the two lines as mutually exclusive
"
"oooo
"
"i think i heard the song when i was a kid ma na never dated
"
"ooooo tell me your meaning
"
"never smoked never drank never broke up if you're still breathing you're the lucky ones, isk idk that's how i perceived it in 11th like, some of us have probably been scarred by love to see the good in it. (hence the corrupted lungs)
"
"ohhhhh okay yeah i see it too shiz you good good at this
"
"setting fires to our insides for fun the wrong kind of overthinking
"
"oh man.
"
"and somehow lovers always go wrong (hence the corrupted lungs)
"
"okay fuck my things yours is so much better and mature like we purposely think about all the bad shit and the fun part is like an oxymoron mocking kinda tone uff
"
"yaaaaa exactly
"
"man you should be posting all this in reddit.
"
"especially the way she sings it
"
"you know it
"
"makes it more oxymoron-like she says it in a vvv exasperated way
"
"didn't notice this but yeah the way you interpreted the lyrics is too stunning ing
"
"chal let me see if there is some subreddit thankssss yooo best compliment
"
"if you were so good at all this indicating a clear level of maturity in highschool why did you spend all the time crying  okay okay sick joke sorry but man, too good the way you perceive everything.
"
"that's why the crying na cause i felt pretty lonely
"
"oh man. sorrs
"
"man i was too busy doing this analysis shit and writing poems it's not that valued then, everybody was measuring each other by pace ranks
"
"a good long lesson you learned and you get to look back at it now when you're happy and you should be happy to have come soooo far 
"

"or with everyone you were supposed to too
"
"yeah vvv accurate heres a playlist for you... acid by anushkatrivedi
"
"oh bro the first line only
"
"hahahaha yaaa even i noticed this first
"
"bro i didn't trip in music enough because i wanted to get the visual in because even they were very subtle since low dosage so maybe you have to do it with me to teach me what's what send me better playlists ufff
"
"haaaan so instrumentals are a lot of fun on acid cause you can use your brain to fill in stuff according to the feel
"
"oooooo
"
"idkkk my first trip i tripped the hardest to beethoven like tesrs tears shutup  yeaaah you should def def def def do a higher dose
"
"oh man that's only instruments hmmm only with the right ones. you are a bitch arghhhhhh

"jk man ik the reason but yeah man okay regret of the vacation.
"
"ya true dude
"
"everyone know this one loll

"
"hahahha
"
"how much he loves this girl ufff
"
"it's a love song?
"
"it's almost like a story yup tells a story without words tbh which is so cool using music he describes the ebb and flow of their relationship ufff i dieeeee legitttt sounds too cheesy but that's why i was crying
"
"the ebb?
"
"like i get chills listening to it even now
"
"post about feels are too fucking real. it does affect you properly for a long fucking time m
"
"ebb and flow  ups and downs in a repetitive way ya dude like i cant even listen to it rn idk why maybe not a relationship relationship but just feelings itself
"
"oh yeah the slow part sounds like the rocky part of their relationship and then slowly bam he happy af again
"
"could be anything
"
"cry no
"
"naaaa like i dont want to listen to it abhi will save it for the next acid trip maybe
"
"just include me in one of the next three trips max uffff i hate that i'm thinking about you coming to bangalore already i hate being so selfish uhhhh but cool cool see if it fits in your schedule lol you need to book your concert tickets
"
"hahahahahha done done okay don't do this jenit yeah for sure dude can i tell you something
"
"yeah i get like this man don't annoy always.
"
"so i'm the kind of person that tries to absorb the most wherever i am. i tend to get lost in it. so i'm not necessarily the best at maintaining contact i may fuck up a few times like, when i went to dharamshalauttarakhand or wherever i could experience something alone i kind of go a little too in it in it and i feel the need to block out the world so i'm more in the moment and i've realised i'm at my peak when i'm like that detached from my phone in the moment writing but whenever i'm on my phone, i'll message you surprise surprise
"
"and that's what i want you to do because you don't know when you'll get it next and everything will be so new there that ofc you'll want to do it all yeah.... like by going awol? 
"
"yeaaah kind of  like i dont do it intentionally that's why i'm saying it now 
"
"then you're supposed to be at your peak all the time.
"
"i haven't journaled since manipal
"
"just send me the writings so i kinda spoke to you even when i wasn't talking to you. get jtt
"
"yes yes
"
"yeah not a pleasant one tbh fu too many things going on at home 
"
"i kinda go off the grid idk
"
"mumbai too
"
"it may happen may not happen yeah exactly i haven't really been alone and home is never conducive for that
"
"yeah anushka just tell me whats going on in your life and especially that overworking brain of yours just want you to be happy first.
"
"oh maaan
"
"f like i can completely understand you wanting to just take the night off after a long day of work in a cafe with the phone on airplane mode and then going home and passing out. and some days are supposed to go exactly like that.
"
"yeah exactlyyy i just thought i'd tell you beforehand what to expect when i go off the grid
"
"you think i don't expect you to do that 
"
"man i just want you to be a part of my life and even thought you're not temporarily i know i'll be caught up with it in no time with one video call so yeah i'm ready for it. sucks i can't be a part of it but oh well you don't get everything you want. you don't have to specify all this jaan. i already know how you work i know you won't not be able to tell me something crazy that happens or anything along the lines. so all i gotta do is wait for when you wanna telllll and that's fine don't be itna oh let me just tell you beforehand, bitch i already know. sorry idk why j typed so much
"
"!!!! thanks yo
"
"whyd you make bois fall for you and then bounce anusha
"
"maybe it's only when they call me anusha
"
"it was on purpose okay  but yeah... i really hope i lose the match too. and dw about me, i shall be just great without you 
"
"ooooh the boy zombie emoji
"
"thank you for not getting weirded out by kissing my injured lip and ugly okay idk what to say to you today. yes i'm in the depressed state ish. i'm telling you i have issues. i think i'm going to look for food in the kitchen. hope i find something. i'll talk to you tomorrow tho.
"
"okay never ever

"if you want to text then feel free i'll reply to that fosho
"
"okay listen up
"
"don't be gay now.
"
"hi jen, and when you feel i'm far away, remember we don't always need technology to connect, you'll be in my thoughts for sure. also don't be sad pls. i don't want to leave for paris like that. i want you to be excited jenit, bangalore is one helluva chapter coming up!!! and holy hell, it's gonna be so amazing! you deserve the good stuff coming up jen.
"
"tldr
"
"cool don't read i'm not summarising this was the summary lmao yeah, sure. yum, tell me what you ate oooof you cold cold now
"
"yep definitely going to be a new chapter that i'm excited about and ready for. and the time spent being single wasnt the shortest. i learn way more when i'm sad and fucked in life and kinda take things a less seriously when life is smooth. too lazy to go but hungry no da. just getting nostalgic so kinda in that zone but yes i'm not sad sad because we are just going to improve from here as individuals. just fucking sucks we can't do it together. missing on someone's growth also gives me fomo lol same.
"
"yeah bas idk what to say anymore awwww go get something!!!
"
"what things are you talking that you wanna improve that you realised this december? wanna talk about it for upar upar se? yeah fineeeee
"
"yeah but i feel like i need that distance yk. i know it may sound rude, but i haven't gotten any time by myself legitttt. and i kind of desperately need ittttt. i feel a little stagnant in life rn, and reconnecting w myself helps me realign myself to my goals.
"
"yes that happens when you like someone. distance is always good i actually agree.
"
"no just the breakdown was a little unexpected. plus, i wanna take a fresher look at who i am and who i've become cause i feel like in a quest to become a better person i have imbibed a ton of good qualities but i may have roped in a few bad ones too. yeaaah thanks for understanding, bfly
"
"like which ones
"
"don't want history to repeat itselffff
"
"bfly. ufff that happens lol be careful
"
"i feel like i'm a little impatient sometimes, a little stubborn, a little selfish and here and there.
"
"stubborn and impatient true you'll become thoda more peace at mind when you have that alone time with just you and your thoughts but with you i've noticed this selfish thing, like you try to do tooo many things for others and when that becomes too much your selfish phase kinda starts. try to balance it out a bit i think. like you have to be selfish. it's every person for himself kinda thing. you come first everywhere and that's self love not selfish.
"
"yeah exactly
"
"try to balance it
"
"yeah this makes sense i just need to be by myself a little cause it helps me get a better idea of my brain otherwise the worst shit comes flying out and this december def showed me small stuff
"
"just asking, you're saying this generally and not just about me right
"
"yeah
"
"it's okay you learn like this only ah i'm glad we had this talk makes me less sad and more excited to the positive future in store for us
"
"glaaad

"cant get rejected if you don't ask out tru tru
"
"yeah
"
"idk just felt like those moments now i'm going to lie down and just think a lot about everything. like nothing specific. but yeah related to this, unrelated to this
"
"okaay
"
"and that's it from me ladies and gentlemen i bfly
"
"i'm sorry i'm a little scared
"
"?
"
"nothing if you get it you get it i'm not explaining it okay umm just tell me if you need to talk to me or anything.

"
"what even. yeah okay
"
" arre okay you tell me then it's fine you don't have to say it just because i have and we don't have to talk about it because we've already discussed everything related. so yeah since you are leaving i just thought i'd tell you the full form.
"
"i definitely love you jenit. i know it's not the dating dating love you yet but it's the hey you've been such a nice and wholesome person and friend to me love you.
"
"you don't have to explain it man i know. because same.
"
"you're such a positive cute soul despite the stupid fkn shit you say
"
"we are twenty-one years old m we know how each other feel
"
"then whyd you say this
"
"isn't that enough. arre because you said that you didn't say it face to face and video call isn't allowed 
"
"ohhhhh okay
"
"not rejected rejected because i know i'm not rejected rejected by you shit that gets you nasty nasty don't forget that.
"
"lmao
"
"yeah you the bestfriend ly lol let's finish this conversation here only. goodnight
"
"feels like a weird end to this conversation but okay we'll do what you want
"
"say what you want then free country i have literally gotten most of mind on chat so i'm pretty much a clean slate
"
"okay okay cool
"
"and don't expect anything in return as such so relax
"
"as in?
"
"nothing
"
"yeah i'm a little confused
"
"nothing good came out of a 2:30 am discussion ever. and this is the reason i don't keep such talks for chats and have ""simple dates"" when they last dates. it's fine anushka let's just sleep on it
"
"what bs we've had some bomb 2:30 am conversations. also yeah if you had a problem w the simple date thing pls be forward then cause we had plenty of time for you to bring anything up that you needed to. cause there's no way i can know when you're agreeing to anything. which is why i ask you something nineteen million, three hundred and seventy-nine thousand, two hundred and seventy-two times cause i feel like i want something and you're just accomodating. missed voice call okay looks like you've already moved on w this. fine cool. goodnight. missed voice call please pick up okay i'm gonna try calling one last time okay, don't pick up. i'm sorry for being cold because this is how my defense mechanism works. but yep, thanks for icing me out. but yeah, will try to change this a little. okay yeah, i'm talking to myself. goodbye then. so you shut your phone down right after it rang once jenit yep, thanks for doing this.
"
"arre but not the serious kind or the talk kind naa that's why i was like let's talk in the morning with clearer heads i didn't have a problem with it at all anushka. i just had different talking wise ideas for the last date but as it turns out your plans were definitely perfect and yeah i had no problem with just spending time with you. i loved our date yesterday and clearly if i had planned it things could've gone south. why would i do something you asked me not to do? like i know we would talk aaramse about it soon enough, like nothing specific just anything we had to talk about, so i was fine with waiting for it.
"
"yeah it didn't really sound like that when you messaged it yesterday yeah but my simple i didn't imply not talking.
"
"the accommodating part is bs bexause thats not how i like to do things. if i had any problem with anything going on trust me i would tell you first and you know it
"
"i meant simple in terms of the planning parts of it. man i didn't mean simple like that.
"
"oh man don't put it like that arghh. i just wanted to talk properly.
"
"i kept saying simple in terms of planning out things. yeah but you clearly didn't understand how it comes across on text. or the fact that you cut the video call. and you're distant messages and sudden vanishing.
"
"yeah man i never said anything against it anyway and j wasn't hurt by it either because hey you feel the way you feel and being honest and sticking by it is the only right thing to do. dw you didn't come off as cold at all. i appreciate honesty to another level and that's exactly what you did. whatever you said showed me exactly how you feel about me and that is the fairest thing anyone could do. why the fuck will be offended, hurt or anything negative regarding that? i'll slap you. i'm so sorry . i knew i should sleep and talk to you with an open and clear mind. that wouldnt happen unless i stopped the convo. sorry 
"
"yeah you didn't say anything. you just started talking weirdly and went offline. so fkn tell me this in a decent fkn manner.
"
"i'm sorry that's all i implied. ofc i wasn't passive aggressive either, just putting it out there yeah this is exactly what i thought you implied so.... you know i'm always in for the spontaneous planning so well you should have told me this is the simple part smh. yeah i definitely didn't hear that.... i'm sorry. . yeah but i kept saying let's talk in the morning. i knew i couldn't handle such convos at night and things normally get worse for me at that time because i say something wrong or don't understand what's going on. i did what i thought was right to have a proper civil conversation with you. sorry for disappearing that suddenly tho. i was not icing you out. i would never fucking do that, i can assure you that
"
"so fkn ask me. i legit said multiple times while we were together that i meant simple in terms of planning. i kept saying stuff on the lines of not some grand plan but see how it turns out i legit told you i've gotten better at the spontaneity.
"
"that cutting was like ""uff you don't consider face to face then fu"" and not the oh i got rejected i don't want to see you. see all these things need to be cleared out in the morning okay i'm sorry for this.
"
"yeah you need to clearly communicate this. according to me you didn't really sleep off and you were upsetpissed.
"
".........  i'm sorry for being so disregarding and selfish last night.
"
"cool. yeah read the moment jenit.
"
"no you didnt say this was the simple part or i didnt hear it i'm sorry. you said that in an unconnected way and i was like yeah i love it when things fall in place with you....
"
"we sat at that sutta place and i legiy told you i feel like i've gotten better at the spontaneous part of things. and i dont feel the need to constantly make some big plan.
"
"i thought you were just talking about the making the plan thing. keeping the thing simple was unrelated to this according to me anushka  i'm so sorry.
"
"yeah but if you need to talk about something you talk about it. don't delay it and regret it.
"
"okay so a future thing. i am not scared of showing my emotions so if i'm pissed or sad that oh she's not in the same place as me (bfly thing) then i'll show it for sure. idk you wanted to have that talk and i was having a nice evening so somethings can be delayed. i wasnt upset of you not feeling the bfly thing at all because that's a place you're in. and j respect that you were honest with me. that's all i want and respect in any relationship, honesty. and that's about it anushka. i'm sorry i wasn't clear and let you assume so many things last night and didn't even clear it and slept off. that was a dick move on my part. and i will not let that happen again for sure. we spoke about what i would've spoken on the date anyway after getting back. but alright, next time i'll bring it up as and when i'm feeling it. but on a side note, i really was just in the moment with you, not overthinking anything, and just having a cosy night with you. i swear to this. and i'm fucking glad i fucking didn't ruin anything by deciding the things i wanted to talk to you about and blah blah spontaneity at its best. and your plans are the fucking best. and i'm again sorry for just sleeping and leaving you alone with too much going through your head. i really am sorry. did you sleep well  i'm sorry i don't know what else to say i swear i didn't ghost you.
"
"yeah okay wait i'll reply properly in some
"
"yep no. ly. sorry. np
"
"yeah hi was eating breakfast yeah, better. it wouldn't have ruined it but okay.
"
"not ruin ruin but i was having a great time and i didn't want to talk about anyyyy of this you didn't sleep in a bt no
"
"okay then don't put it on me by saying i tried to keep it simple. i did not mean simple like that.
"
"and now we both know where we miscommunicated and it's sorted !!!!!
"
"yeah okaay no no all good
"
"uff our first argument cutes
"
"ya. i guess
"
"i guess.  what are your plans anushkaaa go cray behind that thc going to be a while after that
"
"nothing yet i think my mom wants to me help her out w something wby fuck i panic messaged sarthak in the morning
"
"ooohh this exhibition is over right?? too good it went i feel beauts shoppinnggggg
"
"yup
"
"mom is like get ten shirts atleast and five pants 
"
"yaaaa
"
"about what 
"
"yeaaah makes sense you like i didn't say it's about you i just said i wanted to talk yeah i got scared yesterday and today morning. maybe it was cause i was baked last night that i got more scared idk
"
"you said five shirts one for each day hahahha noob
"
"yeah assuming you wash every weekend i said six tho
"
"yeah fine it wasn't luv for me that scared you coolcoolcoolcool 
"
"huh
"
"i'm sorry about the morning thing. you know my network maybe you just care for me too much and me not reply scared you too much. you just getting drugs in the middle now 
"
"yeah not there yet i still feel weird
"
"abouttttttt
"
"last night just give me time and i'm not bringing drugs in the middle i'm just stating a possibility that i may have hyped it too much because i was a little baked. maybe sober me would've picked up that you just wanted to talk in the morning and wouldn't have made a big deal about it but whatever i guess we spoke about it enough
"
"okay i was joking. but yeah it's fine. you mean you feel weird of how events unrolled last night right ae man if you want to talk about anything just feel free. maybe it's clear from my end and i know the dynamics but they aren't so clear in your head
"
"yeah perf timing
"
"so eh idm
"
"ya
"
"aiyo. yeah i have this bad habit of moving on from arguments when they are over too quickly.
"
"naaa nothing else to say as of now no no dw it's clear in my head, i know what i feel and what i want. you can tell cause i clearly messaged what i felt and what i want yesterday night. i'm just a little taken aback by how stuff transpired yesterday.
"
"i know how you feel and i'm sorry i didn't clear everything last night only.
"
"nothing nothing just time
"
"yes alright. it's fine, you'll be more busy in paris and you'll have enough time to just distance yourself and think everything and come out at peace from it all. i'm sorry if i irked some feeling out of you that i shouldn't have. loll yeah drive aaramse give me the hot goss latterrrr

"
"omg hahahaha i didn't do anything man it's all you
"
"cool then no credit to you  how the lazy sunday going girl
"
"good good so i'm feeling this internal disconnect
"
"?
"
"i thought i should just tell you like i can't really describe it but something is cluttered
"
"disconnected to which feelings
"
"idk what to myself
"
"even with the alone and immense amounts of alone time?
"
"yeah it's likr i'm not thinking which i don't like
"
"theek hai. tbh even i started feeling that after coming here like these guys went drinking last night and i was like i'm going to listen to music alone and smoke which i did kinda got bored of it is the surprising psrt okay i understand the can't explain part
"
"i think i fidured it out a little i'm not thinking enough i think i guess i've been occupied w getting set up here and doing all the touristy things and i'm always a little anxious being somewhere cause nobody speaks english where i libe live and that worry doesn't allow me to think about genuine things
"
"ohhh okay kinda makes sense you're conscious about living there.
"
"like i dont feel comfortable at places na
"
"like the pizza thing
"
"like i'm too worried about these pointless things to think about me man i cry too easy
"
"losing yourself is scary. but you know what work is going to be in full force soon enough. spend time on that and then when you get tired from all that
"
"yeah let's see
"
"you won't be thinking about your acceptance in a new city so in the spare time you'll get better quality thinking time
"
"hmm
"
"i think i made sense there so yeah you expect too much out of yourself. you not wanting to plan thing is like your habit. why can't it be with thoughts too like bakwas mat socho itna
"
"cool
"
"and you can clutter in this particular whatsapp chat :)
"
"yep, thank you
"
"what's itching your brain rn tell. like in abstract
"
"how you think it's bakwas
"
"that oh just because you're alone you're supposed to think and have a self connection and all. sometimes due to external factors it just won't happen and it's fine like it's cause for concern but tension lene see which problem has solved itself
"
"yes, which is what i said. yeah tension is the first step of realisation. only then will i actively make a change i'm used to having certain things on my mind when i'm alone and not having them feels a little hollow that's it.
"
"yes this is the problem i think for your mood like. let life go on for once? i understand kinda annoying when you have nothing to do or think this is the solution i was trying to give you but eh. you're going to handle it your way anyways
"
"hmm yeaaah no it's not that at all def but yeah i'll try gonna keep today light
"
"cute good girl go for some chai sutta less sutta is making you think toooo much  okay on a different note guess who will mostly be my roommate snh yeah this drama won't stop mostly its rishab guha
"
"oh damn
"
"you tell me how to handle your bois man they won't leave me alone
"
"yeah even i hope it's not guha
"
"what's his scene with you and how much does he know are the main questions
"
"all good only we don't talk much but yesterday he messaged me wishing me luck for paris it's chill only i don't know if he knows about you, i never spoke about you umm sorry if i sounded cold
"
"oh man you mad or what lol oooo things aren definitely not going my way maybe next city

"

"
"ya sorry hi arre no like all this professional life corporate rule shit it thoda intimidating like i'm too scared to look at anyone let alone girls now  like i haven't made eye contact with anyone except this dude i spoke to bro there are three interns in bangalore and sixty-one in mumbai . so the induction is happen via video calls today so it's hard to keep up thoda because sometimes video is bad and even when it is good can't see what they are writing anyway and i become toooo sleepy after lunch 
"
"oh shittt you got lucky bro! you got bangalore yeaaah tru
"
"only mit people lollll
"
"same.
"
"dude so we decided we going to keep a tally of the number of coffees hot chocolates or whatever we have to make up for the 25k so we are sitting and watching ind vs aus 
"
"omg hahahahaha 
"
"five cups down in two days ezpz 4 hello what you going to do like are you still just getting familiarized with the system?
"
"yum naaaa kind of getting the data set up rn like, how i want it
"
"ufff too cool and then gonna put on ml model scene?
"
"no no no ml abhi just exploratory analysis yeah but i think how i want it is wrong idk why i'm doing it abhi
"
"you have to work so well like your storage format?
"
"like, i'm trying to combine multiple rows into one so it's a row per user insted of like one hundred rows per user i cajt explai but it may causebsome problem idk let's see
"
"yes yes understood see the metrics you're merging if the addition of all those make sensen
"
"like it's time series data so i'm taking the last non nan value
"
"and insert new attributes to give more info after merging i guess
"
"to get the most recent for each feature
"
"oh hmm see see
"
"yeaaah
"
"cool things
"
"that's later only first just getting the basic data set
"
"also please keep backups i have fucked up too many datasets like this  yeppp cool cool doooo
"
"otherwise i have like three hundred users each with 30-40 rows filed with nans
"
"um keep the old dataset then. because normally you don't throw away time series data when you have nans. you normalise it instead to keep the number of rows like it's one of the first things i kinda learned. but okay im going to stop talking 
"
"ya but you normalise when you're predicting something in the future which i'm not.
"
"yes yes i'm not talking only
"
"i think so man i honestly don't know what i'm doing
"
"exploring. part of the job.
