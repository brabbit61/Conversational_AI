"
"i'm more interested in the multiple guys wala part
"
"im not sure because there are quite a few guys i suspect like quite a few im extremely tired cant function at all
"
"man the first question she ever asked there was are you high i was like dafaq everyone i'll toh have to handle mom also as soon as possible wedding small small things are done, she'll feel the void. worse, i'll be in manipal then dude seeing everyone's compliments, i can't wait for the sangeet video 
"
"she is still crying yeah,now shell be all alone she is amazing at initiating conversations like genuinely and those compliments werent like the obligatory ones which one is forced to give so yeah,im excited to watch the videos
"
"genuine enough for them to get us married  dikshita hates you now hahahahha jk dude when my bhabhi told me, i thought she was joking. but then so many people came up and said the same thing. pretty cringey like why would an engineer marry a dentist !!!
"
"are you demeaning dentists obviously
"
"clearly
"
"even rishabh walked off when my other friends were talking about the sangeet or maybe engineers are too vela in life to understand our routine
"
"hahahahaha. good. use it as a leverage in your relationship. we are tbh. but dentistry is like mbbs nahi mila toh karlo 
"
"no. i opted for dentistry i did not put mbbs as my preference
"
"hahahah it's fine ya also i really hope yashvee is as hoe-y as you portraying her to be. i need my boy to get some he's keeps getting hit on by ugly chicks. let's hope this is turns out to be fruitful 
"
"complicated i dont know if he will
"
"god is great dw accha do you know if jheal will be spending tonight over here or there
"
"no i have no clue even i was asking mom if bhabhi will be here or there she did not rely she was very busy
"
"jenit institute of dance af
