"
"which part tell me
"
"the diagrams from uml just draw the diagrams i guess i doubt explanation will come
"
"okay
"
"cool liiistenn thank you soo much
"
"i have no idea i copied it from sahil
"
"ohhhh oki
"
"what was your question explain na
"
"there was two parts a and b
"
"how did you do part b
"
"you add an aging function and an ismaxpri function to your normal code for preemptive priority after selecting the process to execute i.e minimum priority the code for preemptive priority is pretty similar to srtf just check priorities instead of burst times
"
"if all priorities aren't max then next process is chosen with the lowest priority and the earliest arrival time right
"
"yupp well not necessarily earliest arrival time just earlier than current time
"
"yeah i mean if two processes have zero priority then earliest arrival time right
"
"ya
"
"listen after how many quants did you have to call the aging function just let me know when you'll be free for five mins i'll call
"
"not after a time quantum
"
"oh okay thanks also, you don't need to implement a separate fcfs function right? because as soon as the all the processes have minimum priority, whenever the priority function is called ,as soon as the first process with zero priority is found, the process will execute so all the processes will finish in line. which is fcfs so it's fine right?
"
"it should be
"
"alright thanks which oe are you planning to take
"
"not sure
"
"ducking hell nvm
"
"why??
"
"i'm thinking solid state physics or nanoscience 
"
"i took a technical oe last time
"
"matlab man.
"
"but nanoscience sounds interesting it has a pretty decent course plan
"
"i saw the portion for these and we have already don't 95 from both a lot of this was done in chem already
"
"the entire eee department that
"
"do you know anyone interested in either of these courses. i can't do it alone :

"
"send cd paper please how was it tho
"
"loooool lolololololololol
"
"seriously?
"
"it wasn't hard i don't think anybody managed to finish gimme a minute i'll send you a picture
"
"let's hope they tell me that with a writer you get extra time too dude lab end sem also i'll have to do with one hand
"
"fuck
"
"i'll be lucky if i get to write firing end sem they were going to remove the wires on 15th beautiful things sticking out they didn't allow me to take a picture
"
"wtf of your wired hand?
"
"mine come out of the palm hehe ya
"
"aahhhh deth why not?

"he literally had my hand in his hand  the good stuff
"
"yaas boi xd
"
"i'm going to barter it in for some juicy ai. deal? 
"
" deal oh shit i was supposed to send you pictures i completely forgot sorry
"
"dude fuck it i know i'm be xeroxing entire books eventually
"
"who am i kidding with pictures
"
"optimistic
"
"no fucking idea if it is b or c but mostly c
"
"its a really stupid question if the answer is c like you earn one thousand per year
"
"but because they gave interest rate, it creates a doubt but annual equivalent amount should be c only
"
"that's what i thought too but what kind of question is that
"
"the one we need
"
"can you explain the 18k. term
"
"18k is an infinite annual payment the formula for ai in the cc equation expands to so 18000i is the same as finding p given amount a for time t except t is infinity here now once you find p at year four you need to bring that to year zero for present worth so (fp,i,4)
"
"can't you just frame it as,
"
"ya i think so
"
"good luck for the vague exam lollllll
"
"thanks
"
"what's the second paper

"
"oh wait then try one hundred and sixty million, nine hundred and fifty-three thousand, two hundred and fifty and the same password
"
"beaut
"
":)
"
"dude is bayesian theory linear or non linear and in it the number of training instances per class changes the output na what is this called? local something na like some technical word is it called class likelihood
"
"local models? k means clustering? i'm not really sure what you're referring to
"
"same reaction when the interviewer asked me that loll
"
"early morning study sess?
"
"l o l
"
"all existing birds can fly except two for all a bird(a) and fly (a) and (there exists x,y bird (x) and not fly (x) and bird (y) and not fly (y) and (x not equal to y) and in the 13th question, in the production s - a.ab , you have to add the closure elements of a to the item set and the lookahead symbol will be first of b or follow of a only? and if it is first or b then do we have to put the epsilon in the lookahead symbol for the closure items? it doesn't make sense but i'm asking anyway and how many states for this one
"
"yup first of b and if first of b is epsilon then it'll be  18states i think 0-17
"
"or sixteen do you remember getting ,c lookahead for few states
"
"ya vaguely if you've done it send me a picture and i'll check it if you want
"
"it's left hand fuck it thanks tho how much did you get
"
"i haven't checkrd is it in slcm?
"
"god knows
"
"how was pcap? do i even want to know?
"
"had mpi. mostly everyone got the op except me lol but it was actually easy just practice cuda
"
"what was the question
"
"44 matrix of letters divide it into four quadrants and send elements of each quadrant to a process and then you had to check a small thing but mainly only sending which is what i couldn't do bt
"
"auyy fuck
"
"found what i did wrong feel like killing myself now
"
"what dud you do? did
"
"i was sending from p0 to all processes but you're not supposed to send to p0 so as usual i didn't work recv for p0 so that's why it got hung bt i fixed it after coming home

"
"ayyooo deth
"
"hey would you like to do it
"
"send it to me
"
"hello fren in lr(1) grammar, to find the lookahead symbol lets say we have a- a.b, what will be the look ahead for the productions if b will it be or do you find the follow from the original grammar
"
"it'll be  if you have
"
" thanks
"
" why would there be ( in follow of s s is followed by )
"
"but the second s in that production is followed by null so you add the first of the production symbol no which is s
"
"follow of s is follow of s' and that's  to break the loop
"
"fuck fuck i confused those rules nvm thanks what is it has e along other variables if
"
"then it's other variables,e if c-bcde
"
"huh what e you mean epsilon right
"
"a-a.bc lookahead
"
"oh so you always just putinstead? like always for epsilon?
"
"yaa
"
"last question do you know where to score from rn
"
" i can ask a friend ruko sorry fam everyone i know doesn't have any pot

"
"lol wtf you should've said you won't pay na
"
"i wanted to get out of there man. very incompetent
"
"bro pvm
"
"book is with vishwa
"
"i'll ask him only :p doesn't include all tho
"
"formula sheet!! thankyouuu!
"
"dude how do you find effective interest rate if pp  cp
"
"give me an example i'll tell you
"
"18 per year when payment period is quarterly
"
"m1 no you leave them as it is
"
"so the first one won't have two life cycles?
"
"this is replacement analysis na so the first two years for the defender will be sunk cost
"
"yes
"
"and you draw that cash flow
"
"but at year four do you buy the old machine again
"
"give me 20mins i'll solve it and send it to you noope
"
"cooll thanks what are you doing for the ratios man
"
"i studied it in the morning i don't remember anything now r i p
"
"or 1812 this right
"
"ya it'll be this cuz no. of cps in one year is twelve so 11812
"
"cooolll rippppp
"
"this one i'll do in a while
"
"okay cool
"
"debt equity ratio the denominator
"
"only equity is counted so no two thousand
"
"equity shares  preference capitalreserves no you count preference capital also
"
"my sister said that preference capital is included only if you're teacher has said so so i guess include that too
"
"the book said so
"
"smh
"
"so i guess  how did you calculate interest coverage ratio?
"
"yes because ebit - interest  ebt and ebt is given
"
"isn't it just
"
"ebit not ebt
"
"ya this sorry how do you get interest then?
"
"interest paid for the mortgage is the denom
"
"ohhh okiii thanks frenn
"
":)
"
"in stock turnover ratio the numerator won't it be cost of goods sold and not net sales?
"
"bhai a ca solved these questions. i'm just accepting it at this point
"
"i'll also accept idk what's happening i miss engineering :c
"
"to use cost of good you also need opening stock which isn't giving so that's why using net sales closing inventory
"
"ohh okayy i think that's how you do it
"
"yep cool send me any capital recovery sum which has recurring and non recurring calculations
"
"capitalized cost you mean?
"
"yes yes sorry
"
"there's two types
"
"yep thankss
"
"if two non terminals that's are not starting symbols are in deadlock while finding the follow set then we just add  to both of them right? x - yz will first(x) contain epsilong
"
"nope first(x) a,b add dollar to one of them to break out of the loop and then continue as you would normally
"
"only one? and which chapter do we have from flex oreilly
"
"the first three i think
"
"fuck do you understand the instruction count part the associated cost
"
"count the no. of memory accesses add one for each memory access
"
"and one for storing too right
"
"ya store is one i think https:stackoverflow.comquestions36985312calculating-cost-of-an-instruction-in-assembly-language
"
"thankss happy birthday
"
"thanks frennn 
"
"in cuda arrays are stored in local memory right which is unique for every thread where is this local memory? it's not shown in the diagram
"
"reg and shared memory are local
"
"accha it's stored in global only i checked also did you pvm
"
"sort of
"
"doable?
"
"ya ischill
"
"unlike your birthday sad reax only
"
" why macha i didn't need the reminder
"
"aww i'll get you an ice cream tomorrow
"
"dude what to do in the 12tg chapter are you reading everything and are your notes enough for that chapter
"
"it's only .1 .2 .5 .6 i don't think my notes are even there for that chapter slides possible
"
"wowwwww just spent hours doing .3 .4 thanks ks thankss
"
"ayyyy 
"
"stuff is basically a part of something and retains the same intrinsic properties even when subdivided. right? and what about things
"
"which chapter is stuff and things? 
"
"twelve
"
"i can't find iiit deth
"
"12.2.3
"
"okay ya so stuff basically can be subdivided infinitely and still retains the same properties as the whole so you can't identify individuals and things are basically anything you can describe with count nouns stuff you can't divide into distinct objects things are countable and dividing it doesn't give you two of the thing any part of ""stuff"" is also stuff
"
"give examples of things stuff i understoof
"
"aardvark? books anything you can count
"
"accha okay thanksss
"
"dude whats the difference between graph and tree search in a tree search it traversing can get stuck in a loop but in graph search we use explored states ka set so it doesnt go in that infinite loop?
"
"yup that
"
"cool thankss
"
"tree only has frontier
"
"shit man should have studied yesterday
"
"to that
"
"on a after reaching a goal state do we check if other goal states can be reached in lesser distance? or once if we get the answer thenn thats that
"
"i think you look to see if there are more optimal ways cuz i remember reading that it might expand a few nodes on the goal contour before deciding the final solution but i think practically it should be fine if you stop at the first solution
"
"what do you mean on goal contours bro isnt the dfs just s a g1 this is the solution i have but its wrong right?
"
"this is wrong i think they've switched dfs and bfs
"
"it's not even for that lol .
"
"ya dfs is definitely s a g1
"
"see from your notes i'm doing full propositional logic and fol should i do chapter eight from the text
"
"should be enough
"
"great
"
"what is chapter 8?
"
"this js fol only knowledge engineering
"
"eight is fol that they'll mostly ask only questions not too much theory anyway
"
"so this?
"
