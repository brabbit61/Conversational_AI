are you up
ssup
can you please go to dikshitas room and talk to her . she is going crazy
why ? what happened . she just went from my room
related to all this only . she's assuming too much
like
recently in fact . yeah discuss . go if you can na
u first tell . let me see if it's valid
it is . otherwise i would not ask you
toh tell na  . i really don't see anything that happened as such
chale jao plis
jenit . i know her . if i go down she'll be like nothing happened
actually . chod
so u give context first
nothing chodo now
". pretty sick . and im sorry to say, i was v disappointed with her that day"
stay over ?
"idk if it's because of all this or what, but she also has changed or god knows what"
i feel she is going into a shell
atleast talk to the people u want to na . like wtf . i was dam cut up that day . so i just stopped trying
she feels like everyone is taking nethraas side and all which might not be true so she is distancing herself from everyone
"shell definitely have her own side to it, and obviously ull have to believe her . but as a third person i feel it's not fair . to judge everyone based on a situation which others haven't been victim to . dude common . what is this side business idk . we bloody can't just stop talking . she is a good friend to us and hasn't done anything to us . we can't just stop hanging out with her just because some 3rd person doesn't like her . and it's not like sriya and upach also don't talk to dik, they do very very properly . dikshita makes her self feel like an outsider when nethraa is there by not taking part in the convo . yeah like i really felt i wud have done better on my own, but courtesy sakes and the fact that she's a good friend, i din say anything"
i agree to each and every point you just said
"can u please tell me , i really want to know"
i shouted at her also rn . just rn . i told her i'm not even going to listen to her vent because she's being stupid . whatever you said that only . that assuming she's not wanted and all
"ugh , its a mental block . she has to be strong man . and . what did she tell u about the stay over"
i told her all these things now only . she said that day she just didn't feel like talking
some five minutes she stayed and she assumes all this
nothing else . it's being going for a while
yea she shudnt have come up then . simply spoilt my mood also
and y'all were talking about the trips and photo shoot and all that she want invited (she thinks) so yeah . i know
never have i missed sriya  so much . fucking if u need to play pubjee u can do that downstairs . and i was legit trying to study also that day but she was playing
just understand that she's thoda on the edge rn and take her shit for a bit . i know
i really got dam pissed . and i just went to sleep . and then next morning
understandable
i asked her for lunch . she said no
i'm trying my best to talk sense to her
i was like fine i'll go and come and i thought shell stay till i come . and then when i came back . bloody she din even shut my door and she had left . again got pissed . gosh that photo shoot was something sriya n upach did and trip was just some future plans man . and if she isn't even here half the time . how doesn't she expect herself to get included in the topics of discussion . like 8am-11pm ur in class and pp . suddenly u come up for five mins . and u expect things to make sense ? any person would be lost
"you've never made more sense . it's just that rn i'm telling her that it's not just her, others are also getting affected . and that she needs to talk to you properly to figure out whatever is going on"
"and she's not that type of person wholl intrude and ask what's happening, so definitely she won't understand shit"
she's saying that she's never been in so much social drama so she doesnt know how to deal with it . such nonsense so even i got pissed
"i don't see anyone getting affected, bcoz tbh nothing is going on . whatever is going on is going on in her head . atleast i'm not going to go all the way to ask her n all . if she wants to speak or whatever i'm always there . i've tried my bit and if she still feels the same way i really can't do anything  . and for whatever reasons i'm not going to stop talking to nethraa for such trivial reasons . and if that stands as a criteria  for her being friends with others, then ultimately it's just you, jenit, for her . after the stay over day, i've realized i can't do anything . she was way too insensitive ( don't know if it's the right word) and it actually really infuriated me . and i've stopped trying from that day"
"don't blame you . i just shouted at her and i'm done with her cribbing until she decides to do something about it . only with you . idc for any friendships except yours and her's rn . and ya, don't try"
"previous day also i asked her for waffles n all,and some bullshit she said .but ultimately i took her with me thinking i've not spent time with her . but it was all in vain . some formality friendship i don't want to have"
if you're important enough she'll come to you . okay it's not formality . dw . it's just that she is in a messed up place . her fault . just give her time . nothing else .
please help her with it
yes
"and if need be you can send her this convo . doesn't bother me . even if i come off as rude or not understanding her situation, doesn't matter . it's legit the truth"
she said she'll talk to you tomorrow because rn her head is hurting or whatever other excuse she has . just wait it out .
i hope you chilled in goa and din bother urself with this bullshit .
"delete this message, i'll let you know samnese if she isn't willing to do anything . you deserve to know that . then you can do anything and it will be valid . mat bolo aisa"
which message . good tatoo though xd
. daruu
"do u realize, if she doesn't do anything, she'll legit have no one other than u and maybe her kshtij . that guy also seems shady, but whatever their good friends"
i have already told her everything you told me tonight before you told me . and she's getting pissed that i'm forcing her to do all this but i don't feel bad because it's necessary . she knows that only she can handle it now . first half
. whatever lol
chalo i'm sleeping . please go easy on our friend . she's is in that self destructing part of her life . it will pass .
i'm toh normal only lol . you take it light xd . good night
pyar hai . kaise light lu
jj
sup
so dik came
ha . and ?
fuck dude she started crying so much . i felt to bad
divya don't feel bad . i hope everything is chill between yall . but you feeling bad is just bad . just get it sorted and that's all
dude i've never seen her cry like that
phur bhul jak
why
you didn't tell me anything about the crying . dikshita was unconsciously a
lol . but yea then . i told her whatever i told h . and told her to stop assuming shit . and be stronger
we both love you . hehe
and she said she'll be more normal and herself . and then it was chill . normal talk
good girls
yea . and she was like she doesn't know why saurak n paarth dont talk to her . but i told her clearly that she shud never expect that all of us stop talking to nethraa n all . so she says she understood . hopefully she did
please don't ditch her for dinner
dude . i don't think i can go before dinner . i'm really not in a state . need someone to go with me . but . upach n all are on dik ka side
good enough . sober up we'll tomorrow
yea . we all told nethraa . that what agrim did was wrong . and even she agrees
great
just went and chilled with dik . everything is fine
"you won't have to put up with us, and vice versa . whatever happened yesterday could've been conveyed to you in a much better way, and my intention wasn't to hurt you . i just think that you and jenit made it very evident that you didn't want to be friends with us after the drama last sem so i think it's for the best if instead of awkwardness and need for fakeness, we just accept that we're all unrelated now . if you felt bad about what i did yesterday, i'm sorry for not handling it better . i didn't know parth had called you over . hope you can understand that i'm only doing this to put an end to any unnecessary drama that would've happened over time . agrim sent dikshita this . why is he saying 'us' except nethraa dikshita is talking to everyone . i didn't even step inside four hundred and fourteen"
i think us means neths and agrim . atleast he apologized
doesnt matter honestly . he is no one to tell anyone to fuck off . when except two people everyone was fine with dikshita . this is how dikshkta and i get treated when we try to do something right . what to do now . also what werenyou supposed to tell dikshita . tell me also hehe . break mai
when where . i have nothing to say
arre some goasip
i went to her room and told her all that i know
tell me plis ?

this is true only
i can't say because i've never seen him study and fail before . now i'll make sure he passes . next semester he has coursera . so he'll get enough time for the back subjects also

"he'll have two back subjects so total 8, out of which six will have classes so it will be normal only . no . big data i didn't want . intelligent systems i took . all manas people  . rekt"

her mom complimented after we left . so i guess it's fine . lel

yes i'm leaving rn
what happened
kaustubh and i met him . he came with his class people . i told him to come aside and he wasn't . so i started talking and then he obviously couldn't say . then i got too violent so kaustubh took over . he couldn't say anything he was too shut . so we told his classmates to handle him . they said yeah bro . and his friends judged him when i showed them the 21list
oh my god . how come he came with class people
when i called him from my number her got scared and hung up
so did u achieve what u wanted to
"there's  .1 chance of him talking to her . and if he does, none of his friends will beat us up ."
okay good . atleast ur happy now
i directly said his friends are nice and i spoke ekdum acchese and they understood that's it's fault only . yes . enough to not go to four hundred and fourteen today
but did u get physical at all ? . who came with him ? jayant and rishabh ?
and one more . at the start i was pushing him towards side mai when he was reluctant . that's about it . but the way we threatened him
u told dik everything ?
he's not gonna do shit . yes . hasn't replied tho
now atleast talk to properly . bichari . kitna u pushed her away
i honestly don't feel bad which means that's it's fine
: . it's fine . this kissa is over
no . dikshita will fuck up again . she is not understanding her fault . and straight out not accepting it
i doubt shell speak to him now . moreover he won't speak to her
we'll ser
u just talk to her normally
we'll see
why so much drama dude
biggest fight . diksjita is just doing bs now
worse than yday ?
and i'm not compromising about anything at all . way . that also it started at 10pm
what triggered it then . when everything was fine till ten
she postponed her anger till then
one of u has to give in man
before that full day got . i'm not definitely
but she'll try to negotiate
no . she has accepted it . now she's doing the blame game
oh god . she didn't speak to them na today but
yeah but then she got it up . pagao . why are you screaming at dik . lol . chill da . one person at a time . bapre . divya . let me handle both our problems . she sent me your ss . you chill and don't text now
lol i'm not . i'm chilling only
why so angry
i'm not
what were you texting her then
i just got little irritated and annoyed . i went down also . but nevertheless she was in the washroom . now i can't always go out of my way to ask her if she's fine n all . and if i get annoyed i just say it . i don't keep it inside and suppress it like her
arre . she and i are fighting countinously rn so no time to tell and all . truly dude i ve been just fighting . dw . she would have told tomorrow something . honestly the worst fight ever . damn sad . plus her mom left
ya ya let it be . not going to ask her . u sort ur shit out
you need to smoke up and chill the fuck out
why smoke up  . kuch bhii
you stay calm

all sorted between u and dik ?
i mean she just has to accept it now that's all
lol . okay
you deleted this message
come to the eating place . come around six hundred and thirty
i can't come . i'm going to sleep now . head is aching
acha okay . gn
"please be with dik today . we fought again . as predicted, she spoke to pranjal again . and she's like she doesn't even feel guilty"
oh my god . both of you should just get over it . she's going for her event at five na
yes but i removed her from pp so she'll be the block
"why would you do that . what they spoke about, it would have been so awkward"
i tried to sit down and talk to her three times today itself . she's just still blaming me . i'm not taking anymore shit . enough i've also sacrificed . basically that threatening night only
"but if she actually wants to speak to him what can we do man, maybe she'll handle it this time ? . or he might understand and won't do shit"
when she asked did i do anything to lead you on he said you never said no
this is weird
divya i know her in and out . i know she won't handle it herself . and then he's like i have decided i shouldnt talk to you but it's your decision
but it's clearly visible that she doesn't not want to talk to him
"that's the problem, it's not . she will talk to him again you see"
haan thats what i'm saying . she will talk to him . from that day she is saying
what
today right things are not happening . that
acha
see clearly
what
your one week of putting ur point thru . isn't working
true
because she wants to atleast talk to him thoda
il . ik
and u also know that how much ever u try she'll go and talk
think so
so just leave it na . simply y'all will always fight
this is what i will not do . i've had my share of bs since the past 1 .5 years
but somewhere it has to stop na
what happens to things that don't bend ?
what did she say to this . u leave it like that and try to work with it in that state
i think i interrupted her so nvm
i was talking to harshit also that day about this
it is in that state . i have done my best to alleviate the situation . i legit can't do anything anymore . ik
he's like pls tell dikshita to stay away from the weird friend gang of hers lol . yes i know . but looks like she won't listen to
see full gang hasn't done anything so i will not say that
ha whatever
she'll either bend or break . rn i won't even stop it if it breaks . i want an honest relationship . again she waited before telling
stfu don't say things like the . that . oh this is happened yday ?
today . i knew she was behaving weird after oe . and then i confronted her because i always know what's up with her . same bs different day
ugh again you would have gone from good to bad mood
exactly
now both of u are at two different ends . just make peace in the middle
not going to happen . bahut i've done from my end
give her some conditions and tell her not yo come crying to u if something happens
she also said shes glad she spoke to him
coz u had warned her before only
kya bolu iske baad . i dont want such a negative thing in my relationship . so i can't do that
then idk what u can say . arey the worst about all this is
nothing
"now pranjal knws that even u cant stop dik . not like hell do anything , i know he won't"
exactly . she embarrasses me in public everytime . saurak parth pranjal . why should i be at the receiving end of this everytime . aukak nahi hai after that night
but she just needs to change this
idc about anything now tbh . whatever happens happens s . ik i did my best
now don't broach this topic with her again n again . otherwise y'all will just argue . give it some tijen . time
oh i'm not pretending to be normal this time . bass hogaha
arey then when will things get fine . normal dikshita and jenit with no latent anger n all
we can only pray
give it some time . maybe she'll only realize
nope . she's still blaming me
that your not okay with it and it's not in your interest . and you won't be completely normal
no she's like you embarrassrd me and you need to let me make decisions . i'm like you're clearly not capable of decision when things escalate so i made the decision will in future too if a similar thing comesnup
hmm . both of you only need to figure it out
not happening today . she doesn't wanna talk
then what your doing in the night

sorted . i just want to see how to calc some values . that's all
see
i'm trusting this only now
yes nothing is wrong in this
shaadi ke aise din aa gaye lol
. must use her
but the other tables have different fields . what to do for inventory . and if debentures is not given then what to use for debts
long term loan . that's basically has all the values explicitly given
?
whatever is not liquid cash like stock and buildings and all . that comes in inventory
ooh interesting . for interest coverage ratio even numerator has the interest thing ?
yes because ebit - interest  ebt . and ebt is given
why 6 of 14k for interest
that's the interest you have to pay on the mortgage
no like where are these values given . oh the mortgage . makes it a little better to understand
kya hi bolu . even i asked the same questions to my sis lol

arre i filled up on bread . but still had pasta prawns everything . you were a good host dw . we didn't talk much because we didn't you to take tension . aiyo thank you so much :))))
ya dude it's hard to talk in big group . nethraa was like . it wasnt that weird with jenit around . because u we're far away
i spoke to sanjit and all so it was fine . also . do you want cinnamon buns . i ordered
good onen . shahid also u spoke to . kidhar see . se
yes . that same girl from the food stalls
oh that day it was too good . harshit ne kya bola
he was sad
dude i really liked how u paid that guy . he was soo happy . respect rose for you
aiyo . you relax . i realised i dropped it because i was high . not nice
but u paid him . u made a person smile
arre you study . thank you
arey . kal se properly i'll start
same i hope i get 8 . so exams shit except eefm
u'll get . my eefm was the shittiest of the lot . send pics which u took na yday
arre they weren't good
their still better than the others  . jenit .
i'm not listening to shit . please start out of it please . stay . i'm not being rude . you study . no need for such distractions
pls fix whatever has happened
i'm not
". both of you aren't going to be fine . just act a little sensibly, and talk it out"
i suggest you stay out . we are going to talk after paper . but i'm not budging so
i wish i could . but it's my best friend in the scene . and your equally a good friend . so just think rationally
"i'm not accepting anything . yesterday i told her also that go talk blah blah . then she's like i'll party with them in the middle . i've told her i get pissed when she cuts into my time . and moreover, i convinced all my friends for hepta only because dikshita wants hookah . so now she can't do both . i'm not settling for anything less"
but full night shell be with u na . nothing will happen if she goes for like thirty mins . its not like she's going to stay out with them  . ultimately it's you only
that's not happening either
giving her thirty mins of her time with her friends isn't going to ruin anything
no it's doesn't matter . her friends don't give two shits about her which is why they stopped talking to her . and she wants to go apologise to such people
so u want to ruin a beautiful relation because she just wants to say bye to bee friends ?
it's not that anymore . that's just how it started
"i'm being honest here, but they don't coz they're scared of you i guess"
dude dikshita is in denial . she keeps telling that you did it for no reason he didn't even have a crush . knowing that he confessed it two times . once to me and once you her when they were alone after kerela . so you explain to her whatever you want to . don't waste time with me .
"wow . i think she knows what she wants . and she's trying to balance it but your not letting her do the same . idk now, both of you take a decision that's best for you"
see all this half half knowledge is making you biased . so yeah let us handle it
good luck for exams . exam
you too . dikshita here . my phone broke more . so it's not switching on
wtf
ya . i'm at pp now
all fine ?

". atleast give her a spare phone . and send driver ka number . how to find out tomorrow then . and dude . kal ka ticket . u din send to anyone of us . but messages are getting sent on ur phone and so are calls, it's not coming switched off"

but i can't talk now . raat ko i will . lol
. tell thoda toh . all this suspense i don't like
it's about dik only
accha okay cool
ssup
hello sup tell now
haan so . dikshita told me properly what all happened and all . like full series of events . and i just have two major questions . actually one primary and the second one is secondary
okay ask
"why are you so insecure man . when u know she won't do anything . like she'll never even think of it . like why won't u let her go meet her friends for a while and all . what bothers u in that aspect . and secondly why do u get so destructive . like u don't even know how many people are asking her in chennai . her naani literally asked her ten times saying i know u wont drop ur phone like that , who did it"
"dude you get insecure when you don't trust the girl . so like i have told dikshita as well, i'm not insecure about most of the things . with pranjal i just don't like the toxicity and that extra variable . and with her classmates, after the anirudh and some other guybscene happened included alcohol . so i feel she's isn't 100 safe with them . but yes i can't always protect her when she's away from me and moreover she doesn't want my protection all the time . this i learned from this fight . so yes i'm just trying to learn all this and improve . obviously a long way to go"
"two years man, gotta build that trust"
and i really wanted to prove a point being that i'm very serious and at that i really needed her to listen to me . so then she said something along the lines that yeah go ahead and throw my phone . in the sarcastic way . and to show her i really meant it i threw her phone . but yes obviously there's no excuse for it . need to control myself man . im going to do yoga from tomorrow onwards . or i'll toh lose it
"once is fine, not some five times"
dude i trust dikshita . it's her classmates that i don't trust .
and threw her mess card and even tore her hall ticket wtf
"but i've learnt that it doesn't matter whether i trust them or not so fine, i'll accept that . again no excuse"
she just doesn't say anything
aiyoo . i really fucked up this semester
ur lucky
i can't even face her mom . yeah man
anyone else wud have slapped u . or not taken ure shit anymore
but all this will be used in the future fights so  . she did say twice i don't wanna be your gf
"obviously she cudnt tolerate ure drama . u were the one acting toxic . and not giving her , her freedom . lol yaa she knows everything properly, in front of me only they were talking lol . but she also came back to you after u shed some tears"
how detailed was her explanation . and how shitty did i look
which were genuine
yeah i was like whatt
(i hope)
and she's like you don't take all these threats seriously . duh
"no her mom already knew, they were just discussing"
tell toh something from the discussion
they were talking about reimbursement . and they're blaming her only for the damage
from me no ? .
her mom said no . from next time be careful da . she gets equally hurt and upset when u do such things . she's just stronger than u and doesn't show it
man my 2nd toe is longer than my main toe . which implies my spouse is going to rule me . it's in my destiny . so i'm planning not to fight only . even if it's right . let her do whatever she wants . can't say anything now
no it shudnt be like that
this fight made sure i lose the next ten to
tell her what u feel
too
don't impose it . and don't get violent . give her chance to tell u what she wants to do
for sure man . such a bad semester . only wrong decisions i made
ya . but it's not too late . lot of time to learn . ur just learning it the hard way
okay so this is wrong . i've been telling since 1 .5 years that i don't like her friendship with so and so so she needs to put a barrier . she did tell him that she doesn't like him but he still had a crush on her which was a problem for me . now because she can't confront the problem became so serious and then full blame comes on me . so what do you think about her failing to keep her end for 1 .5 years and then gets pissed when i threatened after soo long . life bro
"arey now how she can control his feelings . there might be one hundred other guys who have a crush on her, u just don't know them . she still listened to you when u told her not to talk to pranjal after the bekal thing"
"you do realize that he told me he has a crush on her, and after my meeting, dikshita met him without telling me where he said and i quote, "" but you never said no"" . not really . she stopped fighting only because i broke my hand . otherwise the fight would have lasted entire semester or would have been resolved much earlier"
but now i suppose this pranjal scene is over with . so chuck him . don't let such insignificant people spoil ur relation man . legit on monday u were on the verge of doing that
truly . i'm done with fights . it's my last semester with ber . then she'll be too alone here . akele . i need to keep her happy . masters and job god knows where we'll get . i'll try meeting her in vacations too . let's srr
"exactly, make the most of it . but sorry u need to share house time xd"
mostly going to north india in the summer . might as well go to east too . yeah
ya but in the middle she's going to delhi . so go before that . hahaha but she can be with you for longer . i want my friends to be happy
already going to happen :p . aww
"oho well see , well see"
"okau fine since we are talking about all this, how should i behave with dikshita on the saurak parth topic"
"let her talk to them . it's not like she's going to go chill with them in their house n all . just when she's with all of us, having one casual convo doesn't matter"
have you been molested ?
oh god
were you there when everyone just left her be and no one except me and my friends did jack shit
not again
i'm asking from that pov . i'm sorry it's such an uneasy topic for you
it's not like that
honestly this is the only question i'm concerned with . everything else is in the past
i think that u'll have to ask dik only . of what she wants to do . then randomly one day of she by mistake speaks to them again u'll get angry n all
i think in this she has listened and agreed to with me unconditionally irrespective of what she wants because she knows and accepts the reason . exactly and i want to be prepared for this so that we don't fight which is the reason i'm asking you
"from what i think, she at least wants to talk to them a little . so that's it's not awkward when in a group . tbh the only person ive seen that she gives no shit about talking or not . is nethraa"
doubt it seeing that she really just wants to stay away from the group except you . maybe sriya and upaasana
"that day she was chilling properly with everyone, in sriyas party"

dude this is your only thing bad for you .  please remove time for competitive coding . also how's work . what do you do
"i feel i have time . i just feel lazy . it's good . lot of new things to learn . from next week i decided, i'll start seeing gfg company wise"
it's fine . you work full day . rest is needed . but make sure to do something . also  what new things elaborate toh . whenever you're free . gfg what ?
now i'm free only . going back . geeks for geeks da . arey toh project is based on web applications data ytics and little software dev . we've to make dynamic config dashboards . which fetches config files from various servers and populates the dashboards with comparisons of each server . so i'm learning trying flask django dash n all to make dashboard . and have to learn about web application architecture http protocols n all
company wise ? matlab ? . oho this is only too much learning . and that also good learning . even i'm planning to learn django lol . i'll ask you doubts
"arey they have practice questions company wise also na . lol u atleast know python, that also idk well"
python is just practice dude . i learn new things after seeing random errors only so lel
"and on top of that they have softwares to run bundles n all, so have to learn those adobe softwares also"
chalo this also i'll do then
rg

hopefully i'll understand it thoda . obbv u'll get . max two weeks to get places

but if u get s offer before u have to go there
"no it's my pc, so i'll get the chance anyway"

rarely people get to sit for their pc . idk what s exactly is . but it's pi only mostly
wtf
wait i'll show you message
"so, pc option was started so that you don't miss out on a company if it comes late . hey, just to add to this . almost all the companies last year had s offers . so, i guess for most people pcs did not come into play at all ."
dude this is damn shitty . were we told all this during the orientation
noo . hahaha
remember pranjal
. arey leave that guy
ask dikshita . she knows how to respond to such creeps
now i think he's become better
i mean dikshita started talking to him anyway . so doubt it
how r u jenit
lol not good
i just heard about some things .
ya . dik only told you ?
hence how r u holding up . who else will ? . people already know kya ? . why am i the last
they don't hence i was asking . all the bois also don't know . lol not good
"she legit told me when i texted on the group . i  was too surprised, coz after april ka scene i thought things were sorted"
i didn't tell because i don't even know what's happening
so i don't understand what happenee
same
she's also not telling properly
she can't move past things . and since we are different people she's like we aren't in sync . and since that april thing she hasn't loved me the same way i love her . and that she like always blames me for not having guy friends . me taking away her saurak and parth is also baf
ya she said she cudnt become normal after april
sorry for taking such shits away from her lifenjeez
but all summer y'all were fine na ? no fights n all
and what about the i was feeling when i told her to handle pranjal and she did for so many semesters . then she's like her is more than mine . since all her classmates also stopped talking to her . how is it my fault that they chose pranjal over her . i get blamed for the stuff that are wrong . not fucking my fault . couple small ones . i hate it when people text from dikshitas phone to me . so i tell them shit assuming it's dik . so i was saying bad thing about mahiman to dik only to find out mahimans real sister was texting me . like wtf . and then she's like go relax and don't ruin my day
oh godd
how is that fucking my fault ! . and this has happened many times . and always i've told her this annoys me more than normal so you don't do it . fucking get vedant and vatsal also read my messages
shell do it more i suppose lol
"don't have etiquettes such chuts . no . like i actually get angry not just annoyed . so anyway yes, that's basically the thing that led to her breaking up . oh and she also doesn't like long distance . so i don't know what's going to happen"
"ya this she said . so it was sudden for u , or u expected it ?"
beautiful my journey was in manipal and the end is like game of thrones ka end
"shit mann this is dam sad, din expect it to happen like this"
she did say once she was thinking of a break in the vacation when we fought but she said i handled it well like the fight and cheered her up or something so she didn't do it .
"what she says it, u'll never agree to do some things her way, hence that seems like someone is controlling her . and she doesn't like it"
but except that no idea it was coming
"and she said she's trying to be friends with u . but man that'll be dam hard for u . it's not going to be easy . what i feel is so unfair in this whole thing is that she's finding it much easier to move on than u :( . move on in the sense, trying to move on"
man we both know she's too naive for the real world . sometimes i'm just trying to protect her . like physically . one time she's been molested and one times almost byb1 of her classmates . that takes a toll on the boyfriend . how easier ?
"she's not that affected, atleast she's trying to show she's not and trying to be stronger and saying that's what's happened is the best for both of u . and friends is what both of y'all shud be"
oh . i'm going to ask her out soon after college reopens . i'm planning not to move on only
what why . arey why wud u do that
she has showed me what our future will bebincase we land up together
it'll affect u more if she says no
and i want that . so i'll try to wait as much as possible
"and 7th sem placements n all u can't be distracted . she said it changed for her after april and she din want to be unfair to u, hence she told u . aw"
yes she told me all this . it hurt me too much hearing she didn't love me the same way
ouch . this might have hurt like anything . she cud have said it in a better way
i have read this at least one hundred times
arey don't be that harsh on urself man
i don't know let's see how the sem goes
but now ur talking normally ?
barely . she needs her space for a while and she deserves it
yaa . as it is two weeks left
to fucking long
chill . it'll pass fast
na man
chill jj . everything will soon shall be fine . give it some time
yeah i wouldn't be so confident about that
but even when u guys meet n all . don't force n all . because then it'll end up in the same situation
i'll try
try forcing or not
not . im literally ready to beg her to take me back . i don't even know what else to do because i've done everything i could
but thoda self respect u uphold lol
what will it even be worth if she's not there
yo . did u print time table ?
not yet
get fasst . i want to put on my wall
my cleaner is to good . and he's looking work for his wife . so if y'all needa maid tell me
we just got one today . but where shell travel so much lol
idk where they live so can't say
print
dikshita said she will print and then she said much later she didn't print so i have to
ya she told . so i'll only take na . ull
yes
when
man i'll get it done fuck relax . i told you don't tell dikshita about kshitij thing for a reason and then you go tell her . you're thick in the head or what . you're not making things any better . why would you tell her ? ?
wtff u din say that . but that's not the point
i told you before you left . exactly . don't be so stupid
i wanted to ask her . and it's not spoiling anything
you know all this triggers her especially because she doesn't have class friends . she is screaming at me on pc . and hates me a bit more
she acting like a noob
yes but that's not the point . so thanks for nothing . jeez
you wait da
you don't say anything more and ruin it further
i won't . u simply don't get triggered
"i've been constantly triggered since the past fucking twenty days so when you come and ruin it a bit more than i ruined it myself, i will be angry"
first of all it's not ruined . nothing has happened
full fucking manipal is ruined is whats ruined . so please spare me this optimistism . sorry for shouting . i know you mean we'll for both of us . thank you .
bill jenit
i can't chill . but it's fine
i'm going to go talk to her now
i've decided that i'm going to try my best to move on i guess . please . are you going to get block
no generally i'm going to go talk
the
print out
go and talk properly . she needs the company
ya . let's see how the convo goes
good talk about me not that it will help but at least make her less angry at me
ya thats the aim
thank you
i met her . i have told her not to just be mean and rude to u unnecessarily
you're already done ? . what did she say
i was with her for an hour
accha
but at the same time i think u shud not try to call her and meet her so much
i'll try
it's because u do such things she gets irritated
only now because it's so messy . later it will be chiller .  .
this
okay
but i even told her that she shudnt have given u bt about u telling me about kshitij . she's like she doesn't know if uve told ur friends and that cud be problematic
i'm done interfering in her life .
she doesn't feel so . just let her be
yeah i know she says the same
"and yes about the controlling part . don't try to make her work ur ways, she def isn't going to listen now"
okay . what exactly did she say
like she gave eg about u standing outside the block today
man she says something heavy and then doesn't care to reply . i'm in too much anxiety
and how u were telling her to come down even though she wasn't ready . and u really need to stop giving dhamki about telling ur friends to do something to pranjal n all
plus that's not controlling her . that's just desperation . yeah there's no need to do anything anymore since she really doesn't want that much contact anyway . nothing will make anything better . so i've given up
so i think best way to assure u'll move on is to not text her to often . otherwise it'll always remind u and it'll hurt u
i'll see . yeah but it's going to hurt anyway for too long . three year fucking relationship
i understand
she vaporized and stop caring about in one second . it's fine i'll be fine
"yeq she clearly has moved on faster, but doesn't mean she doesn't care as such"
doubt it
she came two nd in her branch
her marks increased .  ?
in 3rd year . her cg is the second highest . after pranjals
oh okay nice . when did she get this news
she told this to me last night . so i'm assuming she realized y'day
wah . fuck she's so done with me .
. i have ur tt btw
ik
yo . why had u come to meet me aaj . anything specific ?
i just want my tt . what are you implying
oohh . lol . okay . i'll get tom . and why u din take pouch da
my mom had gotten an umbrella for her and she refused to take it . so why should i . anyways she got it for her friends no so let her give them . as it is she mended her friendships right . that also in one day . really shit friendships she must have if they can break in one day and become completely normal again in one day . and she threw a three year relationship for such friendships . so yeah let her do her own shit i can't deal with anything related to her .
oh god . your taking it to harshly on ur self i feel
explain me one thing i said wrong upar
about the friendships
i agreed i fucked up but you should see how those friendships are na . baat karne ke liye i also talk to so many people
"like if she actually says, she shares a good bond with her class peeps, then she actually might . if not all, atleast 2-3 . and she clearly likes being with them"
"kya hi bolu . when you have no one and you get someone you don't really have a choice but to enjoy . it honestly doesn't make sense discussing since everything is already in place . like whatever was meant to be, is"
true . time is all that u need
yes
eyy . good luck for tom ! . kill it
thanksa
how were the coding ques today ?
man one question was permutation so i left that directly . second one was fineish . it was array related so . the apti os and networks thing was actually hard but i remembered most of the shit
good onen . all the best for tom . jenitt . are u in class
no
i got ur timetable . ur phone is unreachable
i'll take later . placements
oohh . u got selected ?
just got done with 2binterview round . 1st was good 2nd was too bar
woah too good . how many people are left
20ish . man after last round i doubt i'll get selected
what scene now
before hr i got out
"aiyo . it's fine, good try . who all got selected"
after hr we'll find out . update for you . completely over dikshita
how come such speedy recovery . who u found
no one . i did some digging and found some interesting things
what
i'll tell you later . much later
this is vv surprising
what i found was too
after i saw you that day . ey why
also you can't tell dikshita any of this . i'm telling you rn so that you don't worry about me haha . thanks for the help tho . oh you're going to love what i found . lovvee . please okay
ya lol she won't want to knw also . chill . i promise . arey anytime . pls tell
haha elaborate . i honestly can't . i have to use this very carefully . it's gonna be fun
thata dam sick . whats it about but . did u meet her though today
i'm going to the seminar right now . let's see if she's there . i tried asking her but like always she acted like a cunt and didn't say anything properly . lol idgaf
wow this is a miracle
i can't wait for everyone to find out
arey pls tell . tell little atleast . what's it about . is it something she's done . or what
basically i got the validation that my random judgements on strangers that's you all heavily criticize are always right . i'm the fucking best wooho
now which stranger is this . pranjal . or kshitij
i'll tell you everything one day
. when
i'm waiting for the perfect crisp moment to tell dikshita . okay i'll tell thoda but you actually have to delete the chat
yes promise . u can check my phone tom
arre relax . long story very short i'm very glad she broke up with me
clearly i can see that . but why . suddebely what happ
revelation
rell . tel
timing has to be perfect divya man
but u knw i'm as curious as u get . but this
this is the little
dam sick . atleast tell which boy is it about
no
okay give tentative date . when u tell
as soon as i get the perfect opportunity to tell dikshita and get done with the entire dikshita chapter of my life . trust me even i want it to happen sooner rather than later
i think u shud tell her soon . before she takes other decisions in her life
and i'm keeping a facade of still trying to move on from her so you have to still play along in public
hahaha okay
i couldn't care any lesser with what she does in her life so i'm just waiting for the perfect time so at least it'll be a good scebe for me . like the more you ask more curious you'll get
ya but maybe her decisions might depend on what ur going to tell her . that's why better to finish it off soon
what do you mean
idk what ur going to tell her . but still . if it's about her classmates u shud tell her asap
but what do you mean by that tell
"arey just generally . for her benefit . if she's hanging out with the wrong people . so if acc to u , u have a reason to make her stop doing tjagv . u shud . before she gets more close to them"
"again, i couldnt care any lesser for her fucking benefit . the only thing i can do is respect that shes a girl but except that i owe her nothing hencei 'll do things my way without really being concerned about the consequences she might face . lol if shes into people with such a low life then good for her let her do . i feel the same way about them as i did with anirudh before the molestation . you do realise that for three years thats what i have done right . i tried . i know i eas right . and i failed . hence the breakup (partial reason) . so why would i want to do the same thing again when i know nothing is going to change with her lol . shes too immature for life and i cant just wait to see how it fucks her up real good"
"yes yes i understand that u don't care anymore . but since u respect she's a girl, before anything wrong happens, u shud must tell her . then taking action after that is her business . u don't even need to care and u have no reason to . ughh i feel she's already fucking up"
and i dont . and whatever i have to tell her wont really change her thinking about any guy . arre you'll understand once i tell you . her loss not mine tbh
ya hopefully . arey and the worst part is there's no one to explain to her other than me rn . i'm eagerly waiting for this . why can't u just tell me before her
lol she's happy that manipal is getting over so . let her start her new life . this will all be over very soon
lol who said
she told me . she hates this place . but i guess that is when she was dating me
aiyo dont say such things
i dont know how she feels now . dude this relationship is like that one bad mock test you take before the actual gre exam
as of now she's enjoying a bit too much now . which i feel is little unncessary lol
tell
what
like how enjoying too much ?
going out with her class peeps n all . just generally . more than she used to before
yeah because she doesnt wanna feel like a loner . because she doesnt even have me then . it will subside before august ends . and then she'll be sad and alone again lol
oh god . pls don't do this man . if whatever info u have is going to make such a difference . why not tell it now only . so that she doesn't get closer to them so they it hurts more
whatever i say to her wont really affect her friendships with her class people . so it doesnt matter !
ooh . then who tf is it related to
plus i dont want to rush to say that thing . you gotta find your time and strike when the metal is hottest
just tell me this pls
it can be related to her class people and still not affect her frienships na ?
that i'm not sure of anymore lol
all these fragile weakass friendships she think are the truest friendships she'll get . and then she calls herself mature . how was i not supposed to laugh my ass off on that
: . god knws dude . i really don't knw whats happening
dikshita is a crazy person just like her sister . with an innocent face facade . too much i learned about her yesterday . prolly more than what i did in three years
"fuck dude, ur increasing my curiousness"
eh this was a bad mock test the next one should be better
this better be some valuable info
i told you the more we talk about it the more you'll die of curiosity
.
no fucking doubt
i trust you gossip lol
if not mine then whose ? . amirightt
correct
what time are your classes till
four hundred and thirty
can you do tp for one hour ? . or some work ? . and meet me at 5:30 ?
or 3-330 break ? . anything urgent ?
i'll try . gossip . i don't even mind coming to emerald to your place to show you everything tbh
pls this . its convenient . or if u want come
i'll call in the break if i get done
what work u hv . your telling dik also today ?
in the break only
then tell both together na
mad or what . i'll tell you everything i swear just wait . it's going to be sweett
tell her from 530 . tell me in the break . easier to meet her coz she also has class till five hundred and thirty
she said it's till 4:30 . last is star
oh god ur making me too anxious
.
ughh . u bunk ur last class
okay if we don't meet in break you come outside my class . i'll go in a bit late since assignment is done
arey itna also don't do
i swear to god i don't remember i was on time for a class so nothing special
acha okay . u call when ur done with dik
that's the plan
cool . and your on tinder ?
who told you
suruchi asked me in class today . if u has broken up
coz her roomie found u on tinder xd
man i'm there only for validation . i'm too shy to talk to anyone
what vaidation
that i'm still at least thoda attractive . dikshita got the self confidence in the breakup so  . divya i'm too happy . also . this is critical . when dikshita asks you what you know because i told you . that's all . if she asks you how i know and all you can't tell her that . our friendship in the future is based on trust of this one basic thing
so what do i need to tell her ?
that yeah jenit told me
acha okay . no inner details
"how jenit knows, divya doesn't know that"
she told me that she's meeting u . so i also told her i'm meeting u . lol
pagal . but yeah that's fine
i have no idea what ur going to unfold
very important . delete the chat . i'll meet you in the break
"see ya . jenit . i just met dikshita ,and she says with all conviction that she djn do anything before she broke up with u  .  and because she's my best friend i believe her . i knw this gave u internal peace and satisfaction so i'm happy for u in that way, but i don't think u shud spread whatever u knw and spoil her image . ultimately u were happy with her for three years man ."
you believe her after seeing the screenshots and the dates then what should i even say . did she finally confess doing more than peck
and clearly she's dam disturbed about it
.  .
i have kept your word and haven't told her a thing about the screenshots
thank you
"she's asked me multiple times about what proof u have, but i haven't told her"
tell her i didn't show you anything ? ! . tel
nono . she doesn't know that u showed me anything . i just said u told me about her cheating on u . she said kissed
chalo fine . i don't want to ruin her image . i want to improve my image that i was a shit possessive bf . if the girlfriend was such a slut what option did i have . and selfish . like the pranjal thing and kshitij thing she's doing is disgusting . but if queen wants her attention then she shall get it from wherever she gets . now i'm not there someone has to entertain naa
but u telling sahoo n all . it's unncessary na
"full college will know . i'm just thinking how to tell her classmates . pranjal talks to sahoo . so that should do it . i'm sorry divya, i know she's your friend but she has hurt and used me for far too long and you'll agree to it . you read the ss . delete chat and send me ss of it ."
which part
full chat
why da  . what
first year connection . i'm waiting for ss . wow you send the wrong person the chat
arey . i'm sending screenshot . i din take pics . i sent u the chat
why ?
too much work to take ss
delete everything . rn . and then send a ss
ok wait
you tell dikshita anything except the insta thing . baas . rest idgaf
hmm
it would have been so much easier to delete just the entire chat no  . let me know if she tell you anything regarding this topic loll
ya
she's too scared to talk to me .  . i'm loving this
but she's dam disturbed
i was never this happy even when i was dating her lol . that how tf i found out ?
she says she's not done anything . and ur bluffing . to disturb her . arey but we cudnt talk much about it because she was with her class peeps
it's fine it's fine . now we both know how easily she can lie .
. i asked her her russia dates again
5th july
yaa
i remember because she broke up with me then
and the convo was 3rd na
yes
dude can i please just tell her . like atleast i want to knw why she did it when she was with u
this is why i don't show you anything
ok i won't . relax
"divya tbh, this is my shit and not yours . if i don't care, that should really imply that you shouldn't care either . plus you know how much i loved her . so me not caring this much obviously has reasons i cant explain to you because i frame it but in my heart i know, that bitch didn't deserve me at all . which is one of the reason i really couldn't care any more for her . let it slide, love from her end wasn't real and hence"
"okay , i respect this"
dik knows . you saw her insta
ik
oh she told you
no
then
shh . it's fine . what did she say lol
she's just pissed that you read
lol . good
invasion of privacy da . now she also knows everything
invasion of trust toh tha hi nahi ? . lol . good
did she confess to you
those are damn private chats . damn private . just cute stuff
i'm glad i got this pyschological liar outta my system . better late than ever right ?
idk what's happening only . whose side to take
shes trying to maintain her image by not saying anything . no ones
ya . i'll not get into this only
but not telling her best friend . all the best with that tag . funny how she told praniti everything and not you
arey it's not about that
"i'm glad you see it from that perspective . if not, you have couple of reasons to be pissed"
"she's saying it's after breakup, whatever happened"
"before  after . i have proof that i showed you so unless i'm a pro at photoshop, you have no reason to believe her . but whatever makes you happy believe it . peck it seems"
leave it now . i'm outta this
but i still wanna know your stand only on this . also meet me in the break . i forgot to give dikshita few of her thinfs
i'm not in class . have class from one thousand and thirty today
same . when are you coming
oops i saw it now . what stuff u have
boosk . any new gossip ? :p
"no re . i just went to buy groceries with her lol . but she knows properly that u read n all . and wtf , why u ere harshit and u judhgibg me like that man"
and did she say anything ? or even tell you it was more ?  . after giving you proof if you're a diplomat about the cheating part then yes .
she said y'all were on a break
like i don't want you to take sides but if you're still 50-50 about cheating then we have no option . you see how she keeps changing it for her cause . she took break on 4th evening or something . hooked up on 3rd . whatever man kinda annoying to even discuss this with you . still at the peck ?
areyy . i'm not denying it that u don't have proof . u do . but i can't force her to admit it . that's all
i'm not . idgaf what she says . but i want you to admit it .  ! ?
we din discuss that
cool
"hmm , if the breakup date is what it is, then she cheated"
good one at your if and else statements . itna diplomatic banoge and then you expect us not to judge you
i really don't know why i'm getting into this . simply i'll get hated on
this also makes you diplomatic . prolly already do who knows
okay good for u
relax . who have you been smoking up with man . i was too surprised to hear
". y'day with sriya and tanisha . i very rarely do it re, y'day was already drunk so i smoked up"
i just saw anirudh and as soon as he saw me he went inside some door to hide .
. uve become one bully
feels good
yo . i know jenit has my instagram and i know hes read my chats with mahi even then im saying that i didn't do anything worse than what he already did with soumya for a reason . if he wants to know what that reason is he can come directly talk to me assuming hes not going to give gaali of course . if he doesnt want to know i have no issues . he can believe whatever he wants to get over me for that also i have no problem . but instigating you or anyone else against me without hearing me out is just not done . come online jenit !
lol . you do know i have already told you that you don't have to take sides . i just wanted you to admit that she cheated
"no i just sent this . i asked her if i can send this to you, and she said yes . go talk to her if u want to"
i'll just text her
. broo . it continuously said u were typing
"i would love to see her explain me what happened in delhi . plus i never even held hands or any fucking thing with somiya ever let alone suck some  . plus he couldn't even keep his  intact before ""finishing too early""  . so  no it's not the fucking same at all . moreover i don't have time to instigate people against her . i just need people to know that it wasn't entirely my fault and how much shit can hide behind her innocent face . because everything just thinks that i'm the possessive shithead who caused the entire breakup . knowing that my possessiveness was right all along (seeing that she did cheat on me with him), it gives me a sense of calmness that i was right all along . and yes she's right, i'm not a good judge of character, otherwise i wouldn't have wasted three years of my life behind a girl like her . and i didn't force you to accept any bs and you know it . she is too immature for me anyway seeing that she uses people just to satisfy her need for attention . and if she calls that her ""new found peace"" then god save her ."
i got scared only ki how much u were typing
i sent it to her directly it's chill
hmm cool . also . drinking with harsha n all nowadays . break up party huh
this was last saturday . last sem . why nott
good stuff . rarely he gets drunk . he apparently went and announced that u and dik broke up . what u did
where  . harshit and all . bought everyone booze
so y'day u treated cse peeps ?
oh yeah . i was like i'm so sad please come because he was too reluctant . no just normal outing . first it was just me harsha arusha and then at the end there were 15ish peope . lol
getting harsha drunk is the best . i really need to see him drunk
man till i was tipsy he said he wasn't drunk . so i gave up on him . then we had just one convo when he was drunk because so many people
then he came back here and had more it seems
to your place ?
"no, to abhisheks house, below  mine"
oh lol . nice . once you start drinking you wanna have more
i swear . that's always me
not everything is about your divya gosh
. i was just saying
i jk ya . is harshit there
ya i'm chilling with him only now . jenit
tell
we shud go drinking once in this extended weekend . harshit n i were talking about it y'day only . wow so serious
don't try to get me drunk and then take advantage of me . idk what to expect man .
"what do u think i'll even do  . no da, all in good spirit . idc if she likes it or not"
chalo done dw . i would be offended if it was
meaning ?
like if she has a problem and you distance yourself from me would be offensive
not happening . pls don't think that i'll text about stuff just regarding her . i don't want to also
only you are thinking all this . i'm toh peace from my side
good
but yeah we'll drink for sure . bakri eid tomorrow !:')
ya harshit n i were saying fot
sort . going there too much this semester . must keep it that way
hahaha . good place to get drunk . ssup . dude on eid u  went to pearl na . they had made the biryani at home ?
yep . nono . pre-ordered from an auntie . anushka and i made the sheer kurma that everyone loved :')
hahah i  saw snap . scenes with anushka huh . so will this auntie just give the vessel  . broo . today supreeth came and asked me . did dikshita actually do what she did .
aiyo no . i always need two friend circles so i've started to chill with my class people more and they were really helpful when i was sad at the start of sem . pretty sure that's what happened haha . what did you say
"i said ya, it looks like it but she's not admitting . vishwa gave him the news"
my nigger be helpful . dude unconsciously missed out on a lot of class friendships because i was dating . kinda sad about that but i'm doing my best to just get to know people i missed out on
"i understand :(( . now she's making the same mistakes . and i'm getting irritated . okay quick help, what to have fireball with"
neat . it's not bad at all just very warm . and you get nice cinnamon taste
"peace, i'll have"
let her be . let her do her own thing . it's her last sem if she makes mistakes it's on her and prolly already too late for anything . good girl
"ya i'm not even going to tell her, it just irritates me . she's only missing out by not hanging out with others . and that pranjal is also p selfish dude"
shit deserves shit . but it's fine . they'll regret or enjoy it in the future so it's all good . only they two hangout full day kya ?
ya dude . even angad n all asked me that day if she's with him
lol
"he was like divya good u moved out, dikshita can be with me then . you have that aunty ka number ?"
man she can do what she wants . only she shouldn't waste other people ja time like she did with me because that's just a shit  mkvie . when did he say that wtf . i'll try asking . but she does only in bulk
that day she called me to crave . i thot shell come to meet me . but she got him also
loll
so he told me then
jo attention de woh toh bhagwan
i got irritated
you should tell her that man
i have . and shes actually considering him to take part with us in tech tatva . one more bt
but pranjal being her pet sounds good to hear and if people think that she left me for him then toh cherry on top of cake
he won't leave us only
. your sacred thing is fucked
"i told her that day only, u dare get him"
because obviously he won't back down
"ya he's to adamant like that . something their doing, god knws"
small village girl gives thoda bhav and baad over .  . try to get out of dik no .
ya i will . that day they went to beach also alone . . she's never done such things with us also . she always said she hated beaches
or me ? ? . she does
but she went to kapu . and she had planned we'll meet on sunday . but alas .
oo now toh i want to know what's up koll . she ditched you for beach ? !
no when i called her she was already at the beach . ya i'll ask her straight . she shudnt play with his feelings atleast
let me know loll
and tell her i'm getting irritated
usko aur uski behen ko aur kuch karna nahi aata
"dude legit she has no one this sem other than pranjal currently . it worries me . she doesn't take effort also, but she knows he's always there"
dude i love this breakup . ex doing bs stuff and me being surprisingly positive in life like i've never felt before hahahah . she doesn't want many friends .
"ya haha supreeth was telling me that vishwa told him as to how happy u are , i was like hahah ask me about it"
ek attention dede kafi hai .
she's mad . nothing to look back and cherish in college . she's not come home two times also . they watch netflix also in the lib dude
dude in the block before i used to tell her to go to your room and chill she used to say no for that also because full day attention quota i fulfilled
i find it cringy
"i can just tell u all this, only u'll understand"
"bhai yeh legit creeppy . honestly, i don't know this dikshita:) . but i like to compare the old one and new ine . talk to praniti dude about this, she's too good . this is how i ended things with her haha"
"you told her about everything ? . eyy dam nice . actually give her number, i'll talk to her"
dikshita told her as soon as it happened because clearly she's her only best friend
lol . no i mean that she cheated n all
is there sadness behind the lol ? . she knew everything
"so she acknowledged what u said na . i mean not really , it's her stuff"
she couldn't snitch so she helped me how much ever she could
il taln to pranu
that she told praniti and not you . you've gotta stop being so chill with her treating you like this and you wanting to know everything about her and helping her .
"arey i try to help her as much . if she only doesn't want it , what can i do . she tells stuff, but maybe a little later lol"
and not full . but i wanna what her scene is because this is too funny . i kinda hope she hooks up with him . stepping down is always a treat for the ex (me)
lol it is interesting indeed . ya pls try
asked i'll let you know
aiyoo . dude . i tried fireball . it's an acquired taste . full medicine it tastes like lol
no ya . just think about cinnamon buns . drinking at home ?

haha alright
i'm texting praniti now lol
let me know all gossip and i'll do the same :p
shit i wrote a very long message
ss please ?
ya wait let her reply
senddss
"i knw she really likes spending time with him etc, he's a really nice guy but she doing all this at the expense of her other friendships . she's not met even one of us in three weeks and has legit just been with him . i'm sure no one wants to spend their last semester with only one person . she's just isolating her for no reason . she might feel she doesn't need more people but i dont understand how u can be like that . i've tired explaining to her a lott of times to spend a little time away from pranjal because that guy likes a her a lot and i feel it's a little selfish from her side for making it so hard for him to get over considering the fact that she always tells him that their just best friends . but besides this, it's fine if she wants to spend all day with him, but i don't feel it's good for her if she doesn't hang out with others . what would u even look back at after college gets over if u just hang out with one person ? . her break up with jenit was ugly , idk what she's upto with mahiman and pranjal but all i knw she's in one big mess and she doesnt speak about it . and i  just feel it isn't healthy for her to just be with pranjal all day because he will do anything to be with her all day but she needs to be a little firm . i try my best to get her to chill with others but she always evades it by saying it's lazy and it's a little irritating tbh . i really care for her, and try to hang out with her but i think ure the one she actually listens to .and u shud actually make  her realize that pranjal isn't the only one for her and she shud actually take a little effort to chill with others . what's the point of college life man when u just have one friend . idk if she realizes this so i just wanted to talk to you about this and actually knw what's up in her mind . you'll be the best one to guide her :))"
good messages . dekhte hai kya hota hai
im genuinely so glad you told me this ! ill definitely speak to her about this because its the last time where you can genuinely spend time with all your college friends who have become family in these four years ! i know she is super close to pranjal and loves his company but he really likes her and she doesnt so it might be misleading for him ! . i think she just enjoys spending time with him and he motivates guides her to study really hard which is why she has been doing so well ! . so there have been way too many things that have happened in the last few months ! whatever she has been telling jenit is to help him move on because i can imagine how painful it must have been for him to break up after so long .
tell her that it's nothing of this sort because last sem she was alone and got her highest gpa . i think forgot to tell her i moved on . tell her lying doesn't give the ex a closure so
good one
did dikshita tell you to not talk to me ? because she did tell me to not talk to you
no she din tell me anything like that . when she told . i heard some recording shit ur going to do
who said . yesterday we met and spoke for like twenty mins lol . tell
"about what . i really don't remember, i was too high"
the gossip finally reached her . sure .
dude i swear . what gossip
you dont forget stuff when youre high . that everyone knows now that she cheated on me
"u shud have seen me dude , i was dead . convo was good or bad"
"shes basically like you know the shit going on in my family please dont my life harder by spreading nonsense . and i said, first of all its not nonsense because i have proof of the date and time you did it and she literally said ""dont go into the technicals i didnt cheat on you"" . and i straight up told her that whatever i'm doing is to make myself feel better and not to make you feel bad . if in the process anything happens then you just face the consequences of her actions . then shes like you are just taking revenge . and i said taking revenge, and me trying to make myself feel better about what happened are different sides of the same coin so she can take it anyway she decides to . and then she was literally jsut trying to win the argument by actually saying random shit that i wasnt there for her surgery but she was there for mine and how she pitied me after i broke my hand and how i ""hit"" her in the car in kerela . (in fact you know that i was just telling her to stay the fuck away from me) . and she also said haha what have you even done for me in the past three years and i died . because legit the last three years were dedicated only to her so i dont know what the fuck was she saying ."
"okay this i don't agree with her, she din even tell u about the surgery  . did she ?"
nope i saw the bandage yesterday onl . and she had pranjal waiting in kmc im sure so why is she just saying futile things
"ouch . u actually did a lot . thats rude, even i was there . dude all my friends are asking me whose the new guy with her"
tell her her new pet . good bonding sess i see
"but ya, apprently they were holding hands and shit"
oh . well thats new news . hmm fine i'll agree this thing actually kinda makes me uncomfy . if its true . who saw this
why . angad i think
im only human . accah . man you are not giving me new confirmed intel only ish
"huh ? . arey i've not seen all this, how can i confirm"
"arre get stuff out of dikshita no . tum bestfriend ho ya ""bestfriend"" ho"
"she had come home that day . she said it's peace with pranjal . arey i don't ask so much detail . it's her life , let her be happy"
accha alright . i cant push you either fair enough
i'll tell u if i knw of some big improvement
"i mean the good thing is, was my possessiveness ever wrong seeing how things are now ? validation that in manipal i've been wrong only about nethraa gives me some sense of peace :p wouldnt you agree"
"lol, maybe . ya but pranjal is clingy . won't leave whatever happens"
i mean its dikshitas choice . if she doesnt want him to leave then he wont . i feel its a toxic relationship or whatever between them because dikshita is using him to fulfil her quota for attention and he is taking all this is the positive light and losing his self respect by getting used . because no way people get this close without a negative thing looming over them . but well anyway its neither of our responsibility to tell people wtf to do (one of the things i learned from dikshita and im grateful for that at least) . murphy's law: anything that can happen wwill happen . :))))
true i agree to this . i am
get popcorn also haahhaha
i think my friends onyl will give gossip about her . because they see her in campus
very  surprsingly i have seen them together only once haha that day when you were giving her her stuff back . include me too thanks
their near the boys blocks
doesnt pranjal live outside ?
noo
"accha . then i actually dont understand how dikshita is playing this . tbh and like genuinely honest, this isnt the dikshita i know ."
don't know what she's doing . as of now this .
"dude honestly just like me, she hurting real bad . we just need to learn how to be single and make mistakes along the way . her this phase is part of the mistake . let her go through . it'll be fine . tbh it's irritating how i can't hate hate dikshita . eh well so be it . i kinda got excited yesterday and told her that she ain't gonna find a better boyfriend than me"
lol what she said then . where did u even meet her
outside her class stairs . nothing really . which wing are you in
e
i'm in c right now

ya  . how was it the interview
i'm tanking it . fucking they did a video call  . i was saying such random things
oh god . but sahil had gd
his profile is different . i got shortlisted for ml role and only seven people are shortlisted for that so i'm scared that they can take
but did u seem like u din knw anything
while explaining the internship thing i implied i copied everything and then he's like do you know how it works i'm like lol no . mostly they shouldn't take . i didn't tell them anything about the part which i implemented from scratch loll
ur mad

"it's fine, it'll be good only . ur simply overthinking . was it s offer ?"
no . no . no
then it's leave . peace . u can still sit for ur pc
vmware won't be worth it so
how genuine was this
why is she sending it to you
?
.
idk she just sent . that u understood what she said . hence this . now tell
idk what she means by this . man i called her bitch and blah blah a little too much on her face . it was a good three years even though it was a big waste of time . i don't want to keep grudges . just increases the negativity . so wanted to complete the entire dikshita chapter peacefully . and soon enough it'll be out of sight out of mind
good enough
now you'll send this to her right
no lol
accha okay . did you tell him something idk yet ? . you're supposed to tell me all this . dikshita said she isn't dating him . like i texted her like rn . do you want to give me some input
who ?
you just reply to thia
harshit came n told me you started dating pranjal ? . wtf . even i sent her this
huh ? ?
idk anything that's happening
did dikshita start dating pranjal . oh
ya . in as clueless as u are
fuck i need to start meditating again . does harshit have the last lecture
no . even i'm home
do y'all have lectures now ?
but peoplw r talking about both of them . apprently pranjal announced

it's called having a fucking panic attack when the teacher is teaching awau
still . if ur so curious to know u only find out na
okay . don't tell me anything about her then from todau
"i don't mind waiting till the news comes, im not probing so much also . when i have something i tell . as of now i don't have anything but ur not ready to believe"
because i didn't know harshit knew first  ! . i thought you told him
exactly . so find out before u yell at me
i'm not yelling man . i wanted you to tell me something to freaking calm me down jesus .
im sorry i cudnt help
it's okay
chill
you don't ask a person thinking 1000 things to chill
idk what ur thinking about . i thot u din care
if you find out about them for a confirmed fact let me know . i have some tricks up my sleeve :)
ya dw . ill stop talking to her if she doesnt tell
stuff guys tell themselves to make ourselves feel better . like definitely over her but it's just hard for some fuck all reason . lol okay
why tf is she apologizing .

"she said, ya tell them i'm dating . because it'll happen"
wahh
aiyo why . go man

loll . after sessional n all she just went out with him . it's sad

i swear . i did hooka for the first time today . yday
about time  . missed out on enough because of hostels . welcome to the fresh air of freedom
it feels dam good going back post 11 . i think all the parties start only post ten
. i used to take snaps in first year if i was out at 12 . tell dikshita to stay over and take her out and show her the real manipal before its over . lol
she won't . i know it . she's happy vid calling pranjal only post 11
eh then let her have her college life . she'll realise it too late that her college stories are as worthless as her school ones . tbh i can't wait for pranjal to get cheated on
"aiyo relax . he told his whole fam n all also . she was telling me that day . ""he got the girl he wanted since 3rd sem"""
dude she hooked up with the two guys i was possessive about and still breakup was my fault according to her  . very movie ish till now . waiting till uska bhi kate  . seems like they both will stay for 8th sem here only
she is for sure . idk about him . where r u interning
nothing decided yet bro . still looking . oh damn . i thought she couldn't wait to leave manipal
same . lol but she doesn't like working . hence project
i hope i get abroad  . otherwise if it's not mumbai then i'll have to keep travelling multiple times . too many functions and what not

it's fine . it's already decided so no point talking about it . have fun with your party . and i don't want to hear anything you say so goodnight :) .
"okay . i'm sorry, i din mean it to go this way . but don't expect u to be fine with it . so respect it . just din expect us to stop talking like this"
dik told me to stop talking to you and i said it's divyas decision . seems like youve made your decision . good stuff .
how is this the decision . i'm not stopping to talk to you . you don't know how many people ask me as to how i still speak to you after you and dik . but i always shun all those comments
you prolly should seeing how manipulatable you are . thanks man . so much . you make tour decisions man
but this i really can't do anything about it
you're a grown up . grown up much
"ugh idk how to explain . it's fine, u can take it as u want . i have no justification"
just don't give me bt in the future with some party i'm not going to be invited to . yep . goodnight
okay i'll take care of that . bt would be if i called u there and then told u to leave
goodbye divya . nice knowing you .
bye jenit . talk once in a while if u feel like
okay i feel like .
i wanted you there . i put u on my list also  . but now if she puts conditions like that n all what can i do man . i don't want people getting bt there
wanted kuch nahi hota hai . if you want then kuch koi nahi rok saktha . and dekhlo kaise dost hai . oh i'm too chill with those peeps . i was drunk today and warmly greeted sriya and all
"she feels u'll go talk to her and some shit will happen . no sriya n all are okay , only dik"
you know the truth so dont want . to say anything . theek . dekhlo
"yes but i can't assure anything  . if itna hai toh, i'll treat u later"
i'm not begging for an invitation . idc about a treat . if you want me there i'll be there . if you don't then you know you'll have my luck .
.
and like i said i'm not eagerly waiting for an invitation :)
okay . i have nothing else to say
night
both of us are right in our own ways
and totally understand that as well
happy birthday jenit
thank you
hi jenit . dikshita wanted me to ask you as to why your adding her back on all social media platforms
. what all . i saw her name on snapchat and i addedn . that's about it . but nevermind tell her i'll cancel the request
insta all it seems . she din accept ?
na bro . i'm telling you no i saw her name on snapchat so i did . snapchat she didn't . uske alava i didn't send .
lol she sent me this
i checked to prove you wrong but she has blocked me lol . fuck :x bro . wait i need to change my passwordn
what ? . you're saying she sent herself a request ?
no man . arre i'm saying samnese i sent on sc
then this ?
of my insta . because no idea about this . when is this from
she sent like last week . and y'day snap chat
"yes this is true . yeah bro i have no explanation for this . i'm not stupid enough to send a request that i know won't be accepted . but yeah apologize to her from my end . send her ss of this chat only . yeah dikshita, sorry for the mishap, need to change my insta password . sorry if you were weirded out by the sc request . no explanation for the insta thing ."
so are you saying you did not send the insta request ?
why will i send and how will i stalk a private profile
why do h need to stalk lol . you know it all
exactly
lol okay . good for him . he was probably drunk
oh bro can you tell me if it was between 19-21 . like when she got the request ?
bro i've come for a movie . ill call u later . wait
sorryy . yeah just tell me this whenever you're free
loll . exactly nineteen
this is getting dam interesting
arre thank god . yeah so i was on a friend's bachelor trip
it's interval now
and we were tripping
so it was by mistake na
someone might have sent it from my phone because they still tease me with her since they only know one girl from manipal . but i didnt do it . and that's more important .
loll . too good .
yeah please send her this too
ysa . send . sent
thanks . one thing she's wrong about because it was muslims bachelor trip so no alcohol
she told me she doesn want to know anymore
ya man even she needs a good story . multiple ex's behind her . eh let her have her day :') . some happiness even she deserves . she could use it seeing the way her college went
aiyo
okay bro i don't want to keep enmity between us . doesn't seem worth it .
"thank you . i have been fine only . you only din accept my apologies . but i'm sorry again . might have been a bitch,but   din mean to hurt you like that"
yeah no that's still not good enough . we'll talk about the treat you owe me in bangalore
. sick guy . we'll call dikshita also
i'm taking one from you .
bro she's not ready to face me and she will have assumptions that i want her back and bs . she hasn't grown uff what to do . clearly the fact that i'm with someone else won't change that . so eh
what . who . anushka teivedi
yaass
what . are you serious
like we aren't dating because she's going to be in paris and all . then hyd
your dating her ? . omg this seems like my life now
but we really like each other and i'm spending nye with her too . whyy . oh wait . amrit thing .
sweet
so how's that going :p
from when
after lab end sem
but obv y'all have hooked up  ?
"okay i swear to god this isn't a joke, i think she and dikshita have stayed over equal number of times"
catch me up !
your parents know ? . arey we talk and all . it atleast you and anushka are in same city . we both aren't we in the same lol
exactly and dikshita will still think oh jenit wants me so yeah let it be only two of us xd . he's in bangalore only no
ya
powai ! that is ldr to
and im in line . pune
oh yeah i keep forgetting
but she stays over and all --
i thought you were taking the visa thing . arre in pragati baba . mad or what in mumbai
oohh . now it makes sense . lol . so shud i tell her or no
man one habit i adopted from dikshita is to be nice to people and not judge . since i'm completely over her i have no enmity . but tell her what exactly lol
that your with anushka . because she always suspected
oh lol i don't think she cares . haha no . i liked only somiya when i was with her  . anushka helped me get outta the alcoholic phase post break up and that's how we started bonding . like post breakup right ?
ya ya
but yeah tell her anything that makes her believe that i'm actually not behind her . want her to have that peace of mindn . oh oh yeah then nevermind perfect . yeah idm her knowing :)
"ya ,i always thought it would be either arusha or jain"
arusha and i are too chill bro . plus she's in an exclusive thing with aditya jain since august

even i don't remember . i had told sriya to ask . but she forgot . so even i forogt lol
i did try with sahoo tho couple of weeks into college but that didnt work out because she's like you're my buddy and i was like tru lol . we were chill after that
ya i knw . you told me this
and so many stories you've heard of me idek  . then directly anushka . lol . made too many new friends this sem so kinda was loving the single life
that's good dude . 7th sem worth it
kinda went too hard tho . one thing dik did good was not let me smoke . lost seven kgs bro what are you saying
haha always good things to look back on . that's bad
yeah she wasn't all that bad . mom's food 4kgs already  . bro all my whatsapp groups are going madd

why will you like your boys ex living in the same building when you're in a different timezone . bro . so the only reason i know my room wont be on her floor is because i got the last bed in the property
true . imagine her . both her exes . she doesn't know her floor and all
she's into astrology no . time for her to do one havan . yeah yeah no one does but mine is separate from all the other rooms . four rooms are thoda separate so
i'm such a sadist ugh
i love that you love to poke .  . poke moree
wait shh . omg
waiting . from jenit only . i didn't understand this . aiyo what has dikshita become
i think she plainly meant she rebounded from you
oh that of course
dude she'll get one shock seeing u there
she is going to breaak . vasvi ? ?
whose going to leave the pg first is going to be a good question hmm . ya
they are rooming ?

stop talking like a kid . same building da
. progressive
i wanna know this tho
that you ask when she slaps you there

"bro she wont have the balls to talk to me only hahaha . when she sees me i'll be like hi, she'll look at me and then look away and just walk off"

but you never know dude . y'all can become good friends
how many years do you want me to waste you tell me . plus kaha ka attitude shes chucking at me i don't understand she was the one who cheated and then dated the other dude i was insecure about . she should be apologetic at the least . but eh i don't expect it from her so good
