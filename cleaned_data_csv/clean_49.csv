"hey, did you solve the question you sent on the group ? the simd one"
yup
can you please send the solution :) . how'd you get n as twenty-five
oh wait . i was answering some other question . ignore that . so i assumed it's the illiac four network . it's the simplest design for one pe connected to four others . and we need r which is root n . and only n twenty-five has a proper square root
isnt there some formula 2n-1 for the number pes one pe  is connected to
um in which topic
wait . this is in barrel shifter
well illiac routing functions satisfies the condition as well
the question has only simd so how do we know which network to select ?
aren't they all simd
exactly
like we only deal with the pes . and there are multiple pes . so i think both work if they satisfy it . like you have make a barrel shifter network within those constraints . mesh network is just easier . afaik most did mesh
alright . thankss
welcome  . hey do we have replacement ysis in the syllabus ?
i'm eefm ? . in . never heard of it
nothing nothing i got confused
all the best
thanks  . uh . what do you mean
like how did they get the associated cost
