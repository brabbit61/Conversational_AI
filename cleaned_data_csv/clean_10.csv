"i didnt have an oe paper know . manipal gets to you after a couple of months, i was waiting to leave man"
tbh even i'm waiting to leave . tomorrow . oh yeahh . too lucky . such a shit sem
yeah man i grew up a lot this sem . all this while i was wayy too comfortable . this sem taught me a lot about people . lmao
i was talking about this yesterday only with my roommate . we became adults by ourselves through and in manipal . i'm waiting for dikshita to grow up real fast since only one sem left . urghh
elaborate
like she gets hurt really fast . only that part . not by me . like other mostly
you do realise you cant go around breaking up and expect her to not get hurt . why so impulsive
she broke up both the times  . like at least said it . and then she's like why you so serious about it man . they are just threats . i'm like
whats the issue with her class people . that pranjal guy . you know he doesnt stand a chance when compared to you . let her be friends then know
everything is sorted . let it be known that jenit took the higher road
idk how you guys sorted it . but okay . one more sem left . enjoy it while it lasts
she wanted something i couldn't give her . so we fought . then i gave it to her . so it got sorted
lol . okay then
may i know what happened with your boy
ill tell you . not over text . too complicated
seedhe seedhe samjha do
arrey . not like this . too much it was
but he a  no ?
towards the end he became one
aww . sad . but it's fine you don't need s . pun intended
yeah true . i just want to finish college and fuck off
"listen . what did anjali tell u . about me not calling her to eot n al . dik was telling . lol . i'm not getting into this . also,  . divya"
"tell her i didnt tell you anything, which i didnt anyway . what does dik know . you told her ?"
not yet . i didn't tell her anything . she might have told her you felt bad it something
are you sure . how will she randomly say that man
dikshita knows that i know and that we spoke about it
arrey man . i specifically told you not to tell her know . ugh
no she already knew da . remember when she video called me . she said she was going to class party . but she was actually going for the treat
that was before sriyas treat
i didn't tell her what we spoke about tho chill . she's just like don't talk about it with her she will feel bad . so i stopped . real classy people in manipal i find it funny
what did you say after this
haven't replied yet
"what are you going to tell her . i hate this gossip cycle, its freakin immature"
you tell me what should i . it's your thing
tell her that you just told me youre going for her treat and i was like oh okay . bas
okay . just one more sem
"lol youre besties with them, im not so its mostly okay with me"
i guess . after things went south with saurak parth nethraa and all we were kinda removed from the group . all the times left seem like weak ties only so
still part enough to be invited to treats lmao . i try as much as i can to stay away from gossip . itll always catch up to you
only with divya . that also because of dikshita i guess . if we weren't dating then i would not have been . and sriya is too close to saurak and parth so no scene there . but receiving gossip is fun . i feel like varys
as long as they arent talking about you
obviously
tell me what she says
but what did she say
"i said,  oh lol okay cool"
she just said hmm
"good one . man, im so out of shape . fml"
lol you used to be that athletic girl with a bf in the first year  . i'm mostly going for a treking trip . need to get into shape before that . i hope i can lift at least 15lbs dumbbells . otherwise i'll be too embarrassed to lift anything at the gym
"still am, just got rid of the bf . i went gymming and swimming and now im beat . ya work out jenit what is this"
remember i broke dikshitas phone ? . now i have to use a dabba phone next sem and give her my phone
why would you break her phone and all . stupid boy . how did she cover that up at home tho
.  . that jenit broke it
ayyoo . great
did you parents know about your relationship
ya . they approved big time also
what was their reaction
"not so great . but then my dad met him . and realised he was a decent guy . checked a few boxes . so he was like okay . for the most part he was, the live in relationship fucked us up pretty bad . i take equal responsibility"
what live in . where did y'all live in the 2nd year
"his last sem, he moved out, i used to kinda stay there too"
aisho . it good that bad uh ? . got
yeah i mean it wasnt as expected
aww he was holding out on you ?  . lol . did you see it omg . tel . oh right you have work noe . so you probably haven't seen it . muhahaha . i have the power
ya im working . so much esd . ugh . but the office is massive . with great power comes great responsibility
which company . hahaha it's fine you're good at it . ded . like so many characters today
nxp semiconductors . i havent even studied this fml . do you want me to hate you ?
"lol they rejected through the automated mail . rip . you're in ice right ? . i know it's there in e . but i'm so nice . dw, it'll be a good episode . once you get back . text me once you're done with it . have to many memes"
"why would you apply here its not even related to your branch, full core rd . ya dik would have enjoyed . ok will do"
"nevermind i checked again, it was dxc technology :p"
omfg . i loved it . what a great episode . arya is my queen . so much happened . jamie dies . omg . danny went batshit crazy . fucking idiot danny . i was rooting for her . ok enough caps . obviously im yet to process this mfin episode . but wow
jon is like .  . meme time
she lost it because he rejected her fucking ruined her character so much .  . but they ruined it for me . its ruined now
who they ? . ruined last episode ?
d and d . ruined characters and show . last episode is either arya or john trying to kill danny . but failing . and then running away . and danny ruling over dothraki the only peeps left
loll . hahahaha . that's def not gonna happen . she ain't surviving got . dikshita got to know the end from somewheres
they ruined her character bro . they built it up and i was so happy one strong af female character . and then boom . this is typical got
all we know is dany is ded . they showed it in the house of undying as well man . true
dik is just annoying like this . gotta stay away from news
she sent me a voicenote
youll also ruin for me ik
and i said i'm nkot listening because there might be a spoiler
plis dont
and she's like no . then i heard it . and i was like wtf . she's like oops . no . you're nice
"if they had killed arya no, i would have stopped watching the show for real"
i won't . dude rr martin's wife would have divorced him
they showed her walking around in ashes
she is def not going to die
which is true
this came out like some ten years ago . noo
lmao
she was in the throne room
shes queen of ashes now
with everything burnt (because as we know she burnt it)
sad girl
and after that she walks into after life to meet drogo . i hope jason mamoa is there in the last epi loll
the only man who truly loved her . yeah ill flip . but listen . everything that everybody does is for love . every single goddamn decision is because love . danny felt alone after john not loving her . went and burnt a bunch of peeps . cersei went crazy first only after robert not loving her . gendry will be daddy version 2 .0 after arya rejecting him
yeah man he is a lord and all now . but we won't see it so eh . na she was like that since childhood . they showed it in the season five premiere first scene too . and love for missandei
too much . and they killed cersei in the shittiest way possible . although she was with her otl . but buried under rocks is just meh
dude i was hoping they wouldn't escape . so so i guess . but jaime killing euron was bs . euron killed two sand snakes in two v 1 . and couldn't kill a cripple . naa
i wanted them to escape and live somewhere happily . only bec i liked jaime . but nvm . fuckboi left brienne
na she didnt deserve that . that's what you get for being so ugly boi . results are out mostly . lol
ya not opening . typical slcm . fuck it
no . its opening . check . fast
nahi bhai
everyone doesnt know yett
its crashing
like your physique
like your relationship .
like your last relationship
"hence, last"
now directly arrange marriage ?
"no, its crashed so hence its last . yours is ongoing da . dont let it crash"
so prolly this hm . never . dw we sorted everything out when we were drunk
shaadi pe bulaana
"by sorting, i mean she got her way without any compromise so eh"
"drunk sorting out is just for action later on, come at me"
"no . its done because rn also shes doing what she wanted to do . and i have accepted it so . i'm not coming at you, i came on her hahahahahahahah"
thats good . details you fucking keep to yourself
thats exactly what she said . wooho
bye jenit
i jk man . i'm not allowed to touch any girl and i'm not allowed to touch her either . im a guru . pandit . gyani
wtf
knowledge is all i seek
why . knowledge is power
i take what i'm given and nothing more . dikshita has a tight leash like that . dude i saw my cgpa and thought it was my gpa and got so happy . then i realised . mann . fuck
mines not even opening so stfu . so your cgpa is 9 .5 . wah
8 .67 . where you get such numbers idk
ayy man thats the kinda cgpa thatll get you a good job . no ones going for the extreme toppers . middle men is enough . jaadu
man don't use hindi . doesn't suit south indians . cringey
youre not the boss of me bitch . my hindi is actually decent . for a south indian . but ya i get what you mean
"the day you are allowed to talk in hindi is the day you stop finishing your sentences with ""uh' . ""oh you already had your dinner uh"""
"i actually dont talk like that . too many stereotypes . fun fact, i dated a jain in school and gave up non veg because i thought it was cooler . fuckin manipulators"
"tbh yeah . lol . but if all smokers are bad, all south indian are uh .  . gave up for how long ? . heshe made you stop ? . hahahahha . we are the fucking worst"
"for like a couple of months . then my friends were like bruh why . sorta, i mean, i was also pretty stupid back then, not anymore ha"
exactly . live relationship will work wowe my bf is the bestt
young and reckless lmao . also life is experiential like that
how many months did you live in for ?
four
"mann . i'm sorry . you deserve better . download tinder and let it ripp . ps you can put no hook ups in the bio . but eh, that's what you need rn (from my perspective) . again, i'm sorry ."
"this i now . this was boring so meh . plus, i need to focus on myself now . to love to give anyone else but myself . no . this makes sense, but i cant seem to find a decent fellow in manipal . so nvm"
"was ? o . interesting . how many failed dates did you come across . tell me about the creepiest one . worst excuse . so you give up like a wuss ? . how will you explore yourself if you don't get into different situations . you won't grow like that no . more you go out, more you'll learn stuff about yourself, hence then only you can grow and understand yourself"
"how many tedx speeches did you watch, oh wise one . i didnt go out on dates tho, so . but yeah i get what you mean"
"wuss . this is me myself and i . all og . i'll set you up with the boi who kept dropping drinks on you . i really feel y'all are perfect for each other . good pair, in my opinion"
harshith ? why do you think hell be perfect for me ? . not like you know me well enough to know whos perfect
harshit . idk why he'll be perfect for you . true . all i can do is try . this is also my motto for engineering
for lyf
anjali . have you been exercising  ?
ya why . watch jumbo
i've seen the original one . not the one that was recently released will be released soon . man i need to get in shape for trek . today i tried 15lbs dumbbells and i couldn't even lift that . it pains . and dikshita wants biceps . steroids is all that's left now
hahahaha . bro dont . man why you resort to such extremes . less marks  start smoking . cant lift  steroids . youre truly living in your own world
you make me self introspect more than anyone i know . hm . see this runs in my family can't help it  . obviously not going to do . i'll just stay skinny i guess . aren't we all ! .  ?
all the more reason for you to not get into it . dik wont tolerate a smoker for sure . even you know that . ive been lecturing about this smoking thing to far too many people . ive gotta stop
"okay . if they're going to stop, then they'll stop anyway . so chill . eh . if you care, might as well show it . man harshit is moving out . he wants to stay with other friends . and our neighbor is moving in . like we all are in the same group but i'm dreading to live with the neighbor because i know it won't be as peaceful . every fucking day new bt . can't catch a break"
convince him not to . who dis boy  . is it saurak lmao .  . are yall ever gonna bury the hatchet
yeah no . he's getting his ass whooped if he comes near me and dikshita he knows that lol . the tall guy from dikshitas party ? . man they are same branch and all . loll no . i don't talk so such low lives . do you even know the reason why i hate them ?
agrim asked dik to get out . something along those lines
it happened way before that
"which was a  move no matter what the context, i was shocked"
nevermind it's fine leave it
hmm okay
this is why i started hating agrim
and nethra also ?
"nethraa because she was a mental torture to dik . and a disgusting hypocrite . this i want to elaborate on . like one instance . so when apratim and vasvi we're hooking up, they'd come to our place total 3-4 times . then months later after nethraa and agrim started hooking up, they used to come to our place wayy to often . and then someone told me she was telling all the girls that it's so disgusting that apratim used those guys for the apartment . i'm like ? ? bitch it's my decision . so when i called out her hypocrisy, she still had excuses for that . and she really was a shit roommate for dik . so that was that . like rn there's no enmity . at least from my side . just like out of sight out of mind"
best solution
man im at this internship . like they are going to test me for a week . and the amount of work he hass given me to complete till monday is just like . umm . wtf ? . chut wants me to implement two research papers . and learn a new language  . i'm look yeah yeah ez
"im teaching myself labview its going great thanks vv much . karlo, this is your life now . where are you interning"
this place called dimension nxg . he's like i hope you join us because we're doing some cool iron man stuff . like with ar . so i'm actually excited . are you just learning rn or did they assign you some task
"just learning to do task ugh . but he died, so like why"
but it's a corporate company no . so it's fine eh . how come they didn't ask you to learn all this before . dude gs people had to do like some 5-6 courses lol . so that his technology can help the real world . and ar is pretty cool . and these guys work with the army as well
"dude gs is the dream . idk bro . have fun, dont do kd stuff"
haha why . kd ?
"okay nvm its a south indian slang . i have a friend working there now and that guy is just killing it, great work, people, cash . hes going to nyc for an intern conference all expenses paid"
i hate all these all expense paid things . yes i won't kd it da . dude my sister's entire office gets like a proper trip every year . like the entire plane is basically just them . then they'll stay at a 45 star resort . while i'm in the local train stuck next time sweaty old dude . dudes . mumbai local are the absolute worst
ya they had a whole movie shot in mumbai locals and how its the og s for love stories
what do you do when you have no idea how to move forward with your project . and are too shy to ask the people in charge . and no one can help you
"1 . google . 2 . ask smart af girlfriend . 3 . grow a pair and freaking ask them cause youre just starting now and you cant be expected to know so much . 4 . if nothing, use your own maaru brains and figure it out ffs"
"nothing . she don't know shit . he didn't reply only  . don't give it so much importance . nothing much in there . also, how was were results  . haw you didnt reply only rude"
. ya sorry work busy
okay
ah so fuckall i cant even open ig until evening . but the suspense is killing me
. man honestly . i don't know if i'll watch it proper ever again . once in a while is fine . they really messed up
oh god . okay start watching chernobyl
dude . so long story short
dont ruin it for me . jenit
im not taking the internship i would have had to work very hard for
oh
and which is 1 .5 hours away
what why . makes sense to not take it
"and i'm getting an internship through reference . so when i went there today for interview and all, one thing i realised is that they don't expect any output from me, i'm getting the letter for sure . i don't even have to go there  . and the problem statement they gave me revolves around what i did properly and religiously in my last internship"
where
"so that i can focus on cracking g the interviews happening on campus and get a good job . cms infotech . see their logo, you might have seen it . it's proper corporate"
how much prep do you need for that tho . so get the letter without even working; youre sorted
we'll find out . dude microsoft give 40l ctc . highest . so i'm sure the prep and competition is going to be instance . i'll do thoda lol
yeah but see . is gre prep enough for placements ot
i'm glad all the good students got internships . i hope they get ppos and are out of the competition . lol
gd and everything is not upto you know . okay
when is your gre
"idk, i havent booked yet, but im thinking about it . tell . whats the general opinion"
how is gre prep related to online tests ? ?
"arrey, same categories , quant qualt and verbal maybe idk"
i don't understand your question
oh but ot will also have coding fml
yes exactly
do i need to prep for ot separately
don't even bother with english for placements . stupid af
and where do i prep from
ask your seniors what kind of tests y'all get . most of our stuff is aptitude or coding . english don't bother da
i have only v minimum companies that i can sit for
branch dependent no ?
ugh
f
no one is giving management profiles
why do you want management ?
"only gs, deloitte, amazon lol and zs"
you're doing mba after this ?
oh i cant do any more core engineering ill die . ya
o . bro i have no idea about management . who told you this tho
"i checked the list, they specified the roles"
if these companies give management roles i'm sure they will have separate category of tests for core and non core
and in that also they pick only mfin cs kids . ya possibly
100 placement for out branch say whatt
bro do coursera management courses . there are tons
ya ive done
great
but i want the mba
time hai ruko
: . your sister is in pwc na ? . thats also on my list . ive gotta start my research
let me know if she can help
whats her profile
because getting in pwc works only through references
ive heard the exact opposite
chartered accountant in the taxation dept
shes ca ? ? . jesus
no bro . this i know for sure .
okay
marrus aren't allowed to not study lol
how many attempts . ya i know; the guy i once dated had one prodigal family of engineers and doctors and what not
"one attempt more than the best case lol . when she finally passed, she came in the top ranks . but since she gave final call exam twice they don't count it something . she's beauty with brains ."
omfg
get back in the game fam
no thanks too much effort i cant . ya i saw wedding pix
dude sulakshana monga featured her wedding picture on their story .
and one girlfriend also so why you complaining
i really got the wrong genes
who dis
not complaining hence the laughing emoji . wait . we'll discuss this later
but tbh . that wedding was so extravagant . omg
"when the back up dancers showed up, i gave up"
it's a status symbol .  . i want court marriage woohoii
"dikshita will leave you there only boy . give little for charity also, whats the need for so much . dude that guy, his sisters wedding cost 50l and i flipped out for that only . mallu weddings are so lowkey its funny . legit one day and everyone packs up and leaves"
yep my parents are damn into it . they gave blankets clothes and food in some village . only to poor jains . no other castes lol . cutee . true . but i don't remember when i last had soo much fun . especially keeping in mind i hate most of my cousins . and i have a lot of them . can't say money well spent but yeah . once a life . udaipur at least 3-5cr
"lol split the bill  . i never understood jains, like you guys are a different religion yet pray to the same hindu gods ?"
"na i'm good . no man . like we don't pray to ganpati and ram and hanuman . we have mahavir . we pray to that chick also . the famous one . for knowledge . during ganpati visarjan, once in ten years parents go for the big ass ganpati"
okay i just watched it . and i dont know how to feel . i feel idk . idk anymore

memes before work is the way to go . thx
man my friend is dropping out of mit to join the army because he done with engg
what a great choice . full power to him
why do you also dislike engg so much hahaha
"i dont dislike it . i just support unconventional career choices . army is a great choice, someones gotta step up and do it . and afaik, you come out super confident highly experienced after stint in the army . my eefm teacher bro . lft commander in navy . and now shes getting a doctorate also . ballr"
haina . what about the ptsd and what not  . but it's fine . he's very patriotic and his brother is already in the army so eh . sharma ji ki beti . i don't even know how it must feel to be so successful lol
dude ive studied more in the last two weeks than i have in a whole goddamn semester . this internship is too demanding
. but is it good knowledge . and are you understanding . and doing something ? . or just like chillin
"ya ya ofc, i need to submit weekly reports and make presentations fml . thats what na, im actually studying"
fking hate presentations . i feel ppt should have never been invented . all these teachers become too relax . what exactly are you doing tho
"testing and validation . lmao . its ironic how im validating things lolololol . good know, so much bullshitting can be done on ppt"

"lol do you think he has a choice . he's the funny guy in the group and he was depressed af today . so like he was going on two trips and he cancelled those because  one more girl from our group is going . and those two are like school sweethearts and then they broke up but hookup on trips . to sad . dude he's beautiful . its just sad . worst,he and his older brother are going to get married together so like not even that special wedding"

the basically told me to sign something and they'll give me price money for my good performance . and i denied to sign it because i knew the repercussions . and not this
woah you should sue . identity theft is not a joke . i mean they basically stole your name and false advertised so thats not a joke
i mean i was in their institute but once they disowned me they should advertise no . they took it down lol
good stuff
must get microsoft
yeah you have bigger hopes for microsoft than me
does it give management
not that i know of :
so there's a twist
what
"you meet i'll show the ss . beautiful . also, 102 over dikshita after what i found out"
wtf . jenit . okay where are you . come to main gate
man i just got home . assignment no so got done early
ayyo . okay meet and fill in on the deets
trust me you can't wait for it
ugh so irritating
okay i'll send you the ss ?
ya
"but delete after reading because i'm not sure if dikshita knows that i have the ss . pretext, they is before the breakup when i thought that were a good strong going couple while the relationship was thoda down . and the chat is with her ex where she was living in delhi before russia"
so this is before she joined college ?
3rd july two thousand and nineteen
so she got back with her ex this vacay . i am so confused
she just hooked up with before breaking up with ne
but she said already broke up . hoping to stay friends etc
when ka are you talking about
"in the ss, shes telling him ki already broke up"
yeah that's after the night they hooked up
how did you even get these ss
next evening . logged onto her insta
sick . oh
and the part where she cheated on me and didn't tell me and still told me that she wants to be friends . that's not sick ?
but you literally just invaded someones privacy . okay anyway . explain fully when we meet . this is scarring
because i needed closure that that bitch wasn't ready to give . i had to do something . lol you don't even know how movie like that break up scene was . confrontation scene . besufsy
okay but bottom line is . shes moved on . so have you ?
thats all you have to stay about whoriness ?
we shall talk soon . i cant text it . but more of this
vn
?
voice ote
lol nvm . meet me soon . but leave that . are you okay . how are you handling this . not with breaking hands pls ffs
"done . i've never felt purer or cleaner . she was very toxic for me without me knowing it and fair enough my mistake . but now i know . i've realised that she confused her love with attention . whoever gives the most attention wins . three years i gave . and then the ex started few months back i guess . i knew their fucking pubg wasn't just pubg . and then she liked that attention better . and now in this semester, she is using that pranjal guys attention to satisfy her need to fulfill ego . divya shouted at her saying that dikshita you need to let that guy move on and not lead him on and she said that she doesn't want to stop talking to him . she confessed to me that she'd rather let her pranjal and kshitij be lead on than me . and i realised that i wasted three years behind a shithead like her but it's fine it was a good journey and j learned a lot and j matured a lot . fuck them cheaters . i'm happy and at peace . thanks for listening lol . readd"

you fucking didn't tell me your thoughts about her and the topic you
"ayyo . i told you, puts her in bad light . but i think you shouldnt go around talking too much about it to people . out of respect . my opinion"
this is an observation and not a personal opinion
its both . especially since youve got closure and youre at an okay ish place( ?)
i don't believe you but if you wanted to say then you would have so well .
"arrey, we will talk about this more dw"
i'm doing it for the pure need for vengeance .
man this is honestly the least i can do to her for wasting three years ya . college life ! prime time . she is the single reason that the girls i've been with is still in single digits . no kidding .
so yolo now
how about you do it first then i'll follow since you said that you are over him:)
oh but my life is pretty damn peaceful rn so im not doing no drama is the way to go
"that's the thing about hookups, you don't have to meet them again loll . after three years i finally think i've grown up because i agree with this . such a time waste kinda thing drama is . something"
