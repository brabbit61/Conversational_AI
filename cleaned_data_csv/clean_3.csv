"
"i told him exactly that i know that you hooked up with her at malaikas party and he said he didn't do it then. that's the only time i took her name.
"
"idk shit man why would you tell him but you shouldnt have man i said hook up people who hook up are not official jenny
"
"i sorted it with malav
"
"and they dont want others to know
"
"bro side note, this actually hurt me because thoda bro code violation so that's the only reason i spoke to him. last time i spoke to him was last summer 
"
"ya i get that but since you arent a close friend and there are a few options only for hook ups you should understand and let go
"
"good way to put sakina  true true. i'm sorry
"
"thanks  but im still mad at you i didnt know you were that dumb
"

"
"bro can't you get your practicals shifted by writing a letter
"
"i really cant do that i want to come man
"

"
"im in the first batch mostly
"
"aiyo  okay so the dates or not fixed or time?
"

"
"chal done
"
"behn ke lode
"
"see you can find any clean itinerary show your brother that ask him to talk to dad no or tell it's humaids
"
"im gonna talk to dad first i spoke to mom
"
"dad said no? 
"
"yeah man sorry jenny i was talking to shailly quite a heated argument i woke up cause she called
"
"everything is decided no bas i just wanted to book asap so that people relax a bit
"
"yeah
"
"if you know your roll number is twenty-seven why aren't you just saying so that youre in batch one on the group
"
"cause the batches didnt come out yet im not mad and who tf is spreading this rumor
"
"we know
"
"i didnt want to unnecessarily say it and then make a fool out of myself if by chance im not in the first batch when the batches come out ill say it,
"
"how much should we delay for you you only say. manali zostel will also go. already kasol zostel is gone
"
"what can i do!!?!? kasol hosteller we were booking not zostel
"
"my friend suggested this after monil said it's booked
"
"and my batch should come latest by tomorrow or tuesday if it doesnt then just book it and i wont be traveling alone for eight hours if that isnt obv
"
"you write on the group this thing so that people can calm down a bit because this is frustrating everyone
"
"the reason im not saying anything cause i cant have pointless convos w hyper people no
"
"they'll become less hyper if you give a deadline otherwise give me one good reason why shouldn't they sit on your head and keep asking you
"
"listen hopefully i am getting done on 24th
"
"this don't write write this
"
"what deadline
"
"that you'll know for sure by tuesday about your dates so we can book manali
"
"im saying this its not confirm im saying it cause of the previous years pattern like one week before exams they give us the batches and honestly jenny i dont want anyone to waste a night either like no shit you up? since you jain af
"
"sup tell whose car are we taking then
"
"why cant i get thru you can you please take yours
"
"dada has taken mine you have to get yours
"
"dude i cant! take another car no hahahha sah weird
"
"mayur sending you a friend request
"
"hahahahha that keeps me going shh whats up how was your version of the trip hey are you okay?
"
"nopeee
"
"what happened ?
"
"dikshita broke up with me i don't know how permanent but mostly permanent
"
"but why suddenly what went wrong?
"
"since last sem. man i don't want to talk about it on text. i'll tell you when we meet damn depressing
"
"okay just calm down
"
"can't don't know what to feel
"
"listen break ups happen its alright you guys will find a way back to each other if its really meant to be i know its easy to say and its a huge thing but you gotta be strong jenny shell come around try to communicate
"
"that's not a problem she said let's stay best friends. she basically said i don't love you the way you do and blah blah let college start man nothing can be done from here
"
"true when is it starting?
"
"i'll meet her on the 22nd
"
"ohh okay how are you ?
"
"hi i don't know man she's acting confusing like we're talking normally but don't know if we'll get back together
"
"what she saying
"
"very humaid shailly situation
"
"are any of you getting engaged? or married? or muslim? so no.
"
"i meant the friends thing but okay don't overact
"
"damn son im just trying to make you laugh or knock some sense
"
"yep completely missed that
"
"look give her the space she needs till you go there then sort it out
"
"dudeee that's what i'm not understanding see i know the politics to play since everyone taught me that. but the thing is that we still just texting normally and in the morning also she sent the first text so like i don't understand how to keep the distance
"
"its simple af just reply normally to the texts dont try initiating convos and just be breezy
"
"elaborate
"
"she may start being clingy if she is one of those girls then also be like bleh for instance ill text you hey good morning say hi morning and dont reply quickly take your time
"
"yep know this
"
"distract yourself stop using yep ew just behave normal and dont start on the breakup topic if she asks whereabouts dont reply instantly and use was out instead of giving proper deets oh god you dont know how to be breezy at all
"
"cool breezy enough?
"
"yes good youre learning
"
"cool
"
"dont be breezy w me ill eat you alive
"
" thanks aafu
"
"anytime jenny

"good dont reply stay busy divert your mind
"
"yeah i found shit to do. i'll do
"
"great and im always here look its her loss and if she was really accustomed to you shell come back but dont try communicating from your side, never reveal all your feelings jenny people are cruel theyll use it against you when youre weak
"
"yeah man i'm too innocent for the world fucking bitches out there must be more careful
"
"yeah thats what where are you now
"
"home
"
"when you leaving
"
"3:45 can you meet now

"
"what time will that get done by
"
"twenty mins
"
"come then
"
"yass im giving a shit rn
"
"bro it's official like dikshita and i are definitely over friends that also down the line she really doesn't want to date me aaj wo clearly samjhai and that's not going change for sure. so that's that
"
"fuckkk i was just gonna text you!!!!! wtf was this!!! but oh no why did you talk to her what went wrong? listen the trash is taking itself out dont ruin things
"
"she really just wanted to concentrate on her life and really believes that we are not right for each other
"
"oh so she took that long to realize but thats how people are
"
"exactly
"
"they want something to just not feel that lonely and then when they think they can survive without it or they need some change they will just come up w the stupidest reason and leave
"
"none words are truer
"
"i know jenny i know how it is but you know what its good never regret it or count it as a waste of time it taught you things
"
"even i'm convinced that she is not coming back so i'll try to move on and see if we can be friends down the line yes
"
"just take the good memories and look forward to better ones
"
"i guess
"
"honestly being friends is not a good option especially when youre the one w feelings
"
"thing is it can't be worse so might as well try lok
"
"like even if you have little feelings for her its gonna be fucked up to watch her move on or have fun or not talk to you that often every damn thing youll notice if youre friends w her
"
"oh i asked her today she's already moved on since she had been confused for so long she just hasn't gotten rid of the routine part
"
"ohh so she did have this at the back of her head you gotta do it before she does
"
"it started when i threatened that guy let's see
"
"how long ago was this?
"
"march
"
"wtf pretty dense chic but anyway whats done is done
"
"she's too immature for me that's true
"
"life is much much much more than this crap obv im proud of you
"
"onto the next one!
"
"hahahahah no but seriously im proud of you you actually were in it for the long run and that takes courage like you accepted her flaws and you loved her and that is why my boy it is her lost loss you focus on building your life and chill and have fun and im always here if you wanna talk
"
"thank you aafu
"
"anytime df 
"
"you know how a sugarcane guy crushes ice with that screwdriver thing. i feel that ice rn lol rip
"
"oh no why did you ask for so much details the more you try to be a friend the more you know whats going on, the more itll hurt you cause maybe she really she wanted the break whos the guy??
"
"the guy i threatened!!!
"
"whutttt she mental my buoy
