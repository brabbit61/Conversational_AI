"
"sorry did it happen

"
"cool can we ping from any pc to x.com or only from the other router
"
"from any pc i think not one hundred percent sure so just confirm the answer with someone else
"
"i tried to set it up from any pc to x.com is not working
"
"oh wait i just saw in the corner is 1.1.1.1 the ip of x.com ?
"
"yes it is in the dns server
"
"if yes then i dont think its possible caz looks like from ur fig ur routers dont send the request toward another router for that address have u configured it to send the ping coming from any pc to go toward the router which leads to that dns server
"
"so to configure pc1 will we have to do ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.2? and the same thing for pc2 right?
"
"yes u will have to do an ip route
