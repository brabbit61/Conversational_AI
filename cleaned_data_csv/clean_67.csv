"hey naveen, i recently emailed you regarding my internship certificate. i haven't received a reply yet. please respond at the earliest. are you seriously going to be this unprofessional?
"
"you should not tell me about professionalism, be thankful i have not written to your college about you unprofessional conduct at work including but not limited to bringing marijuana infused brownies i will make sure that it definitely goes to in printed format to your future employer
"
"i can't figure your fixation on not giving out a certificate, it's much easier for even your end to be done with this. while you writing to an employer or my university could be mildly disturbing, consumption in india isn't a crime, only possession is. karnataka police won't investigate your case, maharashtra police will find nothing on me here. but when that happens, why are you under the assumption that no one will hear about what goes down in the office, how you're all a part of the practice and you're just looking for something to pin me down with. do you want to get investigated for distribution of narcotics in a work-place? do you even have a legal department to represent you? nobody coerced you into getting high neither did anyone bring brownies to your office against your will, as per indian contract law 1872, you're an accomplice in this setting and more liable than i am being the business owner. save your business, avoid an investigation, send me my certificate so we don't have to do this again. it's just easier this way. and trust me, i'm not blackmailing and neither should you. it's just that we can be done with this matter in a matter of minutes. it's very juvenile for a business owner to stress themselves with problems that aren't even theirs
"
"i cannot care less, you were unprofessional with your behaviour at work and last time you spoke you were just saying things for which you should get lesson for, and i am not talking about any legalities here, i cannot care less about your existence but if you want me to give a certificate i can write about your conduct there. you are just an insignificant person who should get a lesson in life.
"
"speaking about unprofessional behavior, weren't you gonna treat the interns with your ""very green stuff"" that you got from north? and weren't you disappointed on missing that night out. and if i can recollect correctly, didn't mohit go high for a meeting ? maybe nothing would have happened if such behavior wasn't being encouraged by the co-founder himself
"
"sure, keep this for when you have to show it to your employers, i am not writing anything good in your certificate you need a job lol should have thought about this before opening your mouth also the more you annoy me with your text worse for you talk to abhisek regarding it
"
"okay let's get facts clear. ps: i've never been intoxicated at work.
"
"okay so i can remove that line and add some more remarks to help your future employer, and i was really busy with a lot of stuff and i didn't insult or made any remark to you, you were very mean and you get what you deserver for it. take it as a lesson and know how to behave next time. `you weren't fair in the way you treated me as compared to rohan. ` that's your opinion, i have never discriminated you should be able to own up to your mistakes by providing me the certificate and i'll own up to everything i've said in return  i have given you the certificate abhisek sent it to you and also your friend is telling me about my financial status, really do you expect to get anything aftet that
"
"not on the job, i'm talking about the events that took place after our internships got over
"
"if i get a message again from you trust me it will not be good for you because of your ill manners
"
"you started texting me on slack saying that you're worthless and what not and you programs don't work even though i briefed you on the entire thing.
"
"you have got your certificate and we have on camera you getting brownies and making everyone eat i never said worthless to you but what you did on internship
"
"everyone wanted to have them and no one knew a source
"
"it did not work as expected multiple times not my problem and everyone else not like you
"
"you also have the screenshot of you bribing your interns with thc for increased productivity
"
"okay cool show it to your employers as defence
"
"man i didn't do jack shit except just ask for my things.
"
"i don't need a job you do my friend really do you remember talking about statistics
"
"why do you want to include the legalities no sorry i don't.
"
"then it is even worse you deserve this even more you have your certificate and stipend paid
"
"naveen let's just forget this bullshit. we both have other important things to do. can we just end this on peaceful terms that won't cause harm to any party
"
"please don't bother me
"
"are you really serious about that bullshit of a certificate you gave me
"
"you should have thought about it when you said that startups like us shutdown and what now yes 100 you don't decide the certificate
"
"you started insulting me which is the reason i said all that
"
"and there is jackshit you can do about it
"
"everyone in the company knows that i love what physiz did
"
"i did not insult you at all
"
"look around you and ask anyone
"
"i said what you did was worthless and you were telling me statistics about startups
"
"you are basically attacking me since it wasn't worthless.
"
"no it did not work, it may have some worth otherwise but lets end it here
"
"i haven't denied anything you've said because i know everything i said. you own up to everything you've said and then we can take the next step to a systematic conclusion
"
"you are not going to get anything and learn this lesson in life all the best, have a great future! the conclusion is you have your certificate which we were obliged to give and you don't get to decided what goes inside certificate
"
"everything is a lie
"
"till now you were giving threats and had a tone of so much aggression and also asked your friend to talk shit to me
"
"which voids the certificate
"
"that's your opinion
"
"give me proof for every line and i'll leave you alone.
"
"why should i give you a proof you were hired not otherwise your code is in dums and is not being used we haven't implemented anything you did you have zero manners what else ?
"
"well that's your loss since i'm receiving the certificate
"
"this attitude is not helping you
"
"and i deserve the certificate which reflects me and not lies
"
"no that's not how it works last message here bye i see you stalking my profiles, i hope you have learned your lesson, i am ready to give you an updated certificate if you write an apology email.
"
"since iaeste require proof of everything on the cv, i'd like you to include the facts that i worked on models for crop classification and detection, disease detection and integration of the models to the webpage (worked with rohan using flask for this). do you approve?
"
"yeah whatever you worked on will be put give me the text to put in the certificate
"
"this is to certify that mr. jenit jain, a student of manipal institute of technology, has successfully completed a summer internship as a backend developer from may two thousand and eighteen - july 2018. jenit mainly worked on developing models for the detection and classification of various crops and diseases by deploying several machine learning algorithms. he was also a part of the development team responsible for the integration of the models with the webpage. feel free to edit it a bit if you'd like. also, in the certificate that abhishek sent me, the physiz logo was slightly cropped, i hope that wont be an issue. thank you.
"
"you will get it before 1st

"not to intrude your new year's plans, but the day is almost over. may i ask whats the status?
"
"you will get before 1st

"alright
