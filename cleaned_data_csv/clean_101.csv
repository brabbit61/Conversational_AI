"linear transformation (full)

"orthogonal isnt included right

"it wasn't, but they asked a question that involved knowing the concept of it. so i suggest you go through it
"
"accha thankss hey, what do we have to with the document you sent on group regarding getting an internship? like there are only email ids present so...?
"
"the purpose wasn't made clear to us either. you could try visiting their websites and see if its possible to apply directly for an internship position there are links to their webpages as well right ?
"
"but how is that different than us applying through those websites before? internshala pure sem kata 
"
"i think because these specific organizations have signed and mou with aicte, getting an internship with them is easier ? internshala is a scam ik xd an mou
