hey man did you start with something ?
no bro  . we need the schema before anything . otherwise how will we design a login
"just have a login with email and password . and signup with name,email, password, address and phone number"
cool .
and you can make a master page with the ui
"and after the login, you have to sign up . sign in"
top bottom design
yep i'll do this too
this is sign up page . this is sign in page
no both together in different panels
yes and i'll tell you the db by evening so you can do ui and i'll do bsckend . today fever is 101 . anyhow your wish
backend includes the db part right ?
"yes db and showing records, editing and all"
okay then you only handle
"for login,there needs to be separate login for admin i think"
and then the login option leads to which page ?
you can see the doc sent by maam
like what all should the page display ?
"home page, shows table of all the buses . and maybe search for bus textbox in top"
we can have the link the top corner or something and then that leads to another content page . i think at the top should be calender tags . the user can select dates . and we have to query it like that . and then display those records dynamically in gridview . i'll desgin a good gridview and all
that's fine
proper ui
yes the data access code i'll write no problem
what does the content page login in let you see
check github if you can find some shopping site already . for admin ?
yes . sup bro
hey man when can you come
bro um they delayed the timing to 5:30 . i'll be done by 6:30ish
ok . what have you done yet ? . and where should i do fromstartwork on ?
nothing  . just thought about the layout and the like few pages . don't know bro . i think we have to start together only after deciding all the pages
okay then try to come asap after interview bro so we can do something today . which interview is this bro ?

yep :p
peace . how's it going beon . bro
"hey . only the admin part is left . and for the gridvirws, i did everything i could but since there is no db i can't test it . so you please do that part . otherwise i think it's coming together well"
yes but did you add the ui colours and look and all ? . that's nice
yep yep . everything
"that's chill then, send it off once you think it's done, i'll do backend in the day today and evening or tomorrow morning we can join anything if needed and finish report"
"yeah so i haven't donr two things . so fir the gridviews, the size of the layout is not proper that you'll have to check after excuting the quety . and second, i have done validation yet . that i'll add now . except this everything is done"
got it after you finish validation send it to me . i'll do this
cool bro . i'll send it after my assignments sap . asap
cool . hey bro by when will you be done ?
almost done bro
peace
thoda text ka alignment issue is there but please just go through the entire code so you know what's up
cool text alignment in what sense bro ?
like label is not aligned with the textbook vertically :p . just see the site . it works a bit
trying it . its a website right ? . or project ?
website
cool . whats the first page .  ?
main page
which pages is this issue in ?
just go through the thing no you'll see . it's nothin major so just start with the db coffee . code
how do i go to the second page bro ? . it doesn't do anything
"because validation is there . username just put anything . password between 6-15 char . and press either if the logins . and for the other same thing, and for email just put x@x"
"got it, when password isn't between 6-15, it gives no error ?"
check the validator maybe something is missing
like no error message
i did add maybe it's not showing for some reason . like validation group might be missing or something
the layout is messed up i think man . its getting covered
has
yes layout is messed up otherwise its coming now . can you send me photos of the db we drew . the three tables . in your notebook ? . theres no logout anywhere bro ?
oh fuck i forgot that . if you do back then it's basically logging out . it was there on the drawing soni forgot . yes wait
"grant edit or upload access to the drive link . i'm going to upload all the files back . i've added code for login, signup and admin part . user part is left . so i'll push this code to drive link, you need to download and make the ui proper for it . basically it's just aligning the textboxes, labels and the field validators . also the gridview for admin buses - where you add buses is huge so make that small - just run through the login page and the two admin pages and make the ui proper bro . do this by around 11:30, i'll finish the user code by then and then do the user code ui . then we'll work on report . call me or pick your call asap"
bro can you send the  . sln fike . how do you import this

try making the ui fine or else is also chill . the one i have is fine
i fixed one full page . two to go
if you can make it better . insane bro . i'll only push the code first again once code is done . then you take these two other files also and see for ui how much ever can be done and then report bro
userpage is the only updated thing right ? . what about the confirmation thing . and bro . for query string
trips .aspx . and book .aspx . these two are for user . added a confirm .aspx . it's done bro using the confirm page working sexy
try redirecting it to the same page . so that some code gets executed in pageload and we won't have to make a new page also
