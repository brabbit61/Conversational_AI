"finally realised that you uninstalled tinder . anyway so continuing the conversation from tinder, have you gone on any dates since ?"
hahahhaa . didn't i tell you i was going to ? . deactivated account the works . i went out with this one guy right after the break up like in may only . but then i don't really want to get into the whole thing right now . you know what i mean
haha did he make it more messy ? . but i asked you to not delete and you went anyway so :(
no no he was nice . we spoke for a couple of weeks but i didn't have to balls to actually meet him . nice guy though he didn't expect anything so that was nice . tinder is too . idk . i don't like it . like at all . not my thing
hahahaha yeah i can tell . this second year girl was ready to come over and i was like uh i'm outside don't know when i will get back see yaa . we been out too long  . but then did you eventually meet the guy
hey . i could've met him okay . i did i did .  . even this sem i've had the worst luck like i think i attract douchebags . like this one experience was low-key scarring . swearing off all this for a while
"oh no, i thought you chickened out  . can't help that there are so many now can you ? .  . man girls having terrible experiences here is so common, it's so sad : . man world is too small . so tinder girl . spoke for a few days . she asked me my insta handle and sent a request . when i was sending her a request i saw dikshitas best friend from as mutual . i  asked her how does she know her and turns out this girl (not even from my college) was in dikshitas class in school"
this makes me so mad like its so common here any none of us really do anything about it . too good . did she know you though . like was she pretending to be unaware
we do what we can . the number of times we've gone to rescue someone or confront someone has just increased over the years . haha no . she said they aren't close not were in school so i'm just going to take her word for it
