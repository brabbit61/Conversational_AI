this is why i dont take her out drinking loll
hahahah
hey . how have you been
"hii . im great ya, whatsup w you ? . just been so busy working here in atl"
be texting you it if the blue kinda gives away the obvious i'm not doing great . summer vacations and after this final year no ?
. how are you coping ? . yas
bad . very bad . i feel someone is like feeding negative shit in dikshitas ears which is provoking her more . she has never spoken in such a bad way to anyone
what ? really ? what did she say ?
five days she stayed in delhi and she's already ignoring me for mahimam
but what did she tell you that you felt it ?
man i can't explain
and like did you understand what she may have been trying to explain ?
two years i feel u comfortable because of someone and i'm supposed to get used to it . but when it's her turn to tell someone to maintain the distance because they send her inappropriate texts and when i handle it in a way she doesn't like it then you come to the conclusion after three years that our basics aren't same . yes that i did . but what happens when it comes to the fact that i wasn't comfortable when she was happy ? . atleast she is supposed to understand my point of view so that she can make it a better environment for both of us
"see firstly, the way you handled it regarding that guy texting her, may not have been the best ! i can understand the concern from your side and like the basic protectiveness one feels . do you really think those messages were inappropriate ? is it just this one person, you told her to maintain distance from ?"
men understand men better . fine i may not have handled it in the best way but at least i asked dikshita to handle it for 2nyears . and even after someone downright rejecting your proposal and saying she's dating someone if the guy doesn't back out then you know something is up with him . and all these middle class boys from villages are like this only . you cant imagine . this guy can't talk in english . so a beautiful girl like dikshita giving him that much bhav is like his lottery ticket . he confessed when i was threatening him that he still likes dikshita . and the same he texted her that youre my diamond and what not bs . one person permanently . and i was just over protective when she went drinking with her class friends seeing that all of them are middle class as well . and keeping in mind that dikshita has been molested twice in manipal
my diamond ? are you serious ?  . wtf ?
he wrote twenty-one such cheezy things for her 21st birthday
handle it for two years as in ?
"and then all her class friends chose that guys friendship than their friendship with dikshita . and then it's my fault and they don't give a shit about her friendship that they stopped talking to her . i knew since the start that this guy was behind her so throughout the two years i kept telling her every once in a while that, yeah that guy, hmm just tell him to keep his distance . friends with sab theek hai usko bolo crush apne pass rakhe . and for two years he had a crush on her . little attention from a hot girl and it means that she should be hit on irrespective of whether she's dating or not . he  . and another guy whom i told her the same thing, she's like no he toh considers me as his bro and all also confessed to his feeling at the start of this vacation ."
"see, i totally understand where you are coming from . ill speak to her ! what ive been telling her and i wanna tell you also is that youll cant give up so easily . problems do come, need to sort it out . it might be at its worst rn but next semester atleast give it one more chance and then decide whats best for both of you . you dont find people who you connect with so strongly so easily ."
i found about it 2months later but yes men know men better . i am not planning to give up anytime soon .
so have youll been talking or no ?
although she will be ready to give up as i think her ears are being poisoned . barely . the reason i can't talk to you is that you make me very very very angry
by who do you think ?
either her sisters or that chut mahimam . i don't love you like that anymore . also mahiman for sure
"see i think she is super mad about you coming across as too protective and insecure but again i know where youre coming from . for now, just give her, her space to cool down . if you keep talking to her about the same thing, one would just get frustrated and speak rudely . she is w her family rn so she may not be thinking about all of this so much . just give it some time and give her same space to actually understand and see it from your perspective too . when do youll get back to college ?"
"no her basis relies on that everything from my perspective is shit . and that she doesn't love me anymire . and that i'm not the right guy for her . i'll see her on monday if she agrees . and like while discussing also rn she's like can i help you with anything else blah blah . she blames me for telling my friend that she got molested and she needs to be taken care of and she needs to leave the house where it happened because i wasn't in manipal at the time . and mind you, my friend did take care and her and she got away from the place where the shit happened and kept her fucking safe . i have done everything in my power to keep her safe and away from shits . and surprisingly those are the reasons why she can't be with me . she actually gave a conclusion already saying that i don't feel any love for you and youre not the one for me . and she framed it exactly like that . so yes that's what's up with me right fucking now . has dikshita asked you not to respond to me then let me know"
"no no, im so sorry, im leaving for nyc tomorrow so i got back home from work v late so just packing and stuff . i havent spoken to her only . how come ? . okay, thats wrong . i had no idea about this . i can totally imagine, how upset you must be right now but let me speak to her and understand her perspective too ."
in manipal . i think her perspective is i don't want that anymore . oh that fucking mahiman i'm going to kill that guy one day
"okay relaxx, calm down . let me just speak to her once . college starts ? . so early ?"
yes
"oh . so the most important thing i feel is that no matter how angry you feel, please please dont be aggressive while speaking to her . if you have no plans on giving up like you said, the first has to be speaking to her super calmly when you do face to face . like i can image all the different emotions you must be feeling but please please be super calm"
what am i supposed to about her blaming me for everything wrong in her life
"you need to sit her down and explain point by point why you did certain things in a certain way- being completely calm . she may not respond the way youd like but you have to have to give her time . nothing is gonna happen by aggression anger or force . if she is saying that the love has gone: . you need to make her fall for you naturally and for the reasons youll started dating in the first place . anger, aggression and stuff is not gonna help at all . you have to be super calm and give her space and time"
thank you i'll try that . if you talk to her and find out something o should know please let me know that
"and the most important, idk if youve already done that but you have accept your mistakes . ofcourse . like throwing her phone was definitely not right so just accept it"
i've accepted and apologised door everything anyway . i have nothing more to lose
"okay thats good ! two years is no joke, you need to remind her of all the beautiful things that youll shared in a natural way . and honestly, when i was in cal and we went to mbar that night, it was so so evident that she loves you so much . in one month, such a strong feeling cant fade away . its a phase, everyone normal person goes through it"
apparently they have been fading since march
"you just need to support her, be w her and remind her of the bigger picture"
if she even agrees to meet
"dude honestly, she wouldnt have called you, sat in the bathroom for thirty mins talking just about you . if she didnt have anything . she herself isnt realising a lot of things because she is so preoccupied rn"
exactly . but the way she puts it is just so hurtful
i know how she happy was when your dad sent that message to your sister saying i met your bhabhi today
the words that she uses
"i know i know, its a phase . trust me, one of you has to be strong . and rn its your turn to be"
she told me she didn't want to even be physical with me on the last day she just did it because she was drunk . like wtf man
oh god . i dont know what to say
she has been pity saying be for months now
let me just speak to her once
alright
just that i know she is way too preoccupied rn to think anything properly . like coming to conclusions is v easy but fighting through it is hard which everyone just runs away from
i'm ready to fight and do whatever it takes . she had already given up . and we both know her . she is not mentally steering enough to do any of this by herself . she is just listening too much from too many people
yea i know what you mean and i feel half the people who might be saying crap dont even know you properly . so are in no position to say anything at all . i might be wrong on this . dont know how well you know all of them but you know what i mean
her five day reunion with mahiman when she was single was just a vulnerability advantage that he took and is using it . i just know it
has she said anything regarding that ?
you think ? she is too stupid to know when guys are being guys  . her gullibility is one of the reasons for the situation because i try to balance that out for her as well so she learns and grows up . i'm telling you . men know men
yea i can understand
hey praniti . i'd like to please keep this conversation between us and not tell dikshita if that's okay with you . i need know how dikshita moved on so quickly . i can't sleep knowing that a three year relationship ended just like that . i know mahiman was bad mouthing me . is there anything going on with pranjal or kshitij or mahiman that makes her care so less . she tries and tells me that she wants to be friends but it's so surprising that she doesn't care that much anymore
yes ofc ! . there isnt ! she just enjoys hanging out w them . ive had this conversation with her . and she said she doesnt have anything w any of them but just pure friendship
and this ? . i need closure so please tell me anything you can . i need to know so i can move on too
"i just feel that whatever happened, impacted her so much that over time its just all gone . i can totally understand how you feel"
i believe you . you seem trustworthy :) .
i think you should tell her this and have a final conversation with her ! ask her everything you have doubts about in person . like please dont keep so much inside yourself and keep asking yourself what went so wrong . you need to speak to her
she doesn't care enough and i can't have a conversation with such a person .
"im genuinely telling you everything that i honestly feel ! she herself hasnt been able to explain it properly to herself or to me . everytime ive asked her, she has always pointed out to the possessive and aggressive factor which we cant deal at all . if you dont, youll never get the closure you want . she . oh hahah lol"
it's fine then fuck it . no closure it is .
"dont do this ! please just try and have one honest conversation with her . be like, just keeping everything aside, can we honestly and openly talk about everything for one last time for mine and yours mental satisfaction . please do it"
i can't have a conversation with someone that disinterested in me well
just keep everything aside for once
how about you give me some insight into things she hasn't told me so i know what to talk about since i don't know where to begin
"ive told you everything that i know so i guess there isnt anything else, dont over think it"
alright thank you :) . hey praniti .
"hii, this is so sweet ! really means a lot ! same here i really hope you make it to gtech haha and i find a job here  see you . micchami dukkadam"
