u need to ask me specific questions re . yes indexation for capital gains i know
so like you know how it's better than fd and savings right ? . toh like aapna hai kya investment usme i just want to know
its case specific . i dont think we make investments in securities
yeah i know we invest in our business only and get a return on that
yup
but like do you know if it's better than securities and a rated companies
not really how to yse it . it depends on the current market rate of interest
debt funds ka it's 7 .5 . but then the better thing is that you don't have to pay taxes on the interest until you make it liquidn . apne company mai toh interest par bhi karte hai na
yes we give loans

kitne minute ka hai  ?
fifty-eight
cool . solve kiya  ?
no send solution
tu chalu toh kar
can't man
and then what you dont understand puch
send full . what to include and what not to
the first additional says 2002 . whereas the question is of 2017 . typo hai kuch  ?
don't know . you deleted this message . over here it's not mentioned that it is nominal so we just use 12 only right
what is nominal  ?
like if it is 2 per month then 24 nominal compunded pet month
okay . its 12 with compounding
so when you take total payment period n 24 in those formulae you use interest as 1 which is the effective interest right
yes one per month
how is cl six thousand
the stock in balance sheet is always the cl stock
arre don't you have to get this from the lhs
lhs are liabilities . stock is an asset which will be on rhs
cl is current liabilities only na
oh that you are asking . see na ive written the break up of cl . how the fig is arrived
accha got it thanks . in long term debt why didn't you take preference capital . in shareholders equity
it ideally should include only equity . but in some cases pref shares are also taken  ! . it depends what is the right thing for your professors
"okay . then in interest coverage, why are you adding interest of a mortgage . shouldn't you add interest on investments . what does bills receivables mean"
its like debtors only
and payable ? . is like creditors
its like a instrument like a paper which states that so and so money is to be receivable by you . yes
accha samjha . in this cost of goods will be cash purchases ?
no . see the formular in the sheet i had sent u yest
arre but i'm not understanding what is given dnand what's not . what do those statements under the table mean . like purchase returns . sales returns and all . cost of buildings will be included in inbentories ? . and what about in average inventory
its basically additional information given over and above the table to help you calculate the ratios . no its a fixed asset . this i explained you na  ! this basically reduces your purchase exp in the trading ac
yeah yeah this was before i caled
oh cool . today is your exam  ?
yes loll

"i'm getting good support from friends . since it's the start of the sem (and obviously not on the placements ) we've been drinking and chilling ! . so it's fun . one company, i qualified twice to a good level during the entrance rounds but got out before the hr interview . agar milta woh wala toh 24 .5l ctc . lol . more than you :p . this first salary thing is a competition with you that i wanna win"
hahaha . so the interviews are still on  ? . great  ! . itna milta hai tum log ko  ?
yes ongoing like every week there's something or the other . this is the highest . but normally 10 toh hota hi hai . nahi toh i don't sign up for it lol
if you dont sign up kya karega . kidar toh karna padega na
for few companies only . mil jayega no worries
coolio . off today  ?
had classes in the morning and then at 1pm
ohh okay
i have so much gossip for you . loll . which makes me say . lol thank god dikshita left who needs such low life shits in my life .
jenit relax . she has her reasons . you did wrong too . so no need to bad mouth her
bro when i'll tell you you'll also be like wtf
ohh  did she cheat on you  ? is she with that other guy  ?
"you should be happy . what i found out just made moving on too easy . yeah her ex . who her door ka cousin . like how archie richie are for us, same relation ."
what a bitch  . good you dodged a bullet
tell me how to take revenge . it should be severe enough but it should also keep in consideration that shes a girl . and girl image is necessary
jenit you will do nothing . no revenge no bad feelings . just be happy that now you are in a good space . she will get what she derserves . karma has its way and it will bite her hard if she is wrong . you will do nothing . for the sake of past years . promise me
you know i'm psychotic enough thats why i'm asking you for the appropriate revenge . obviously i don't want to degrade her image
thats what this time pls dont be you . listen to me for once
but something that makes her feel as shit as she made me feel
just this one time
i can't promise anything
dont feel like shit  ! you should be happy that you are clean
i'll let you know what i do :p . true . and i am
dont talk to me if you do anything as such . and i mean it . be good do good inspire of the fact however anyone is
okay but atleast i want her to know that i know . and then i can stop talking to her
are you still talking to her  ? . n how do you know she cheated . be sure before doing or telling anything
matlab she wants to be friends . fucker . so yeah i'm keeping facade so that i can tell her that i know and then not talk to ger
you might be just thinking crazy as far as i know you
yeah so . don't shout . you'll be mad . and sorry
im not shouting . just telling you . sorry for  ?
so i logged onto her insta and read the chat
and  ?
and that's fucked up . i read her chats with her ex . from her account . that's not cool at all . identity theft hai
n chats have something which makes her cheat on you  ?
they spoke about whatever they did on the chats
okay . you tell her she did wrong . just tell her . go with dignity so that she realises what a good guy she has lost
i can't confess that i logged onto her insta
if you do anything bad then she will think the same that you are thinking right now . leave her with dignity . just tell her that you know she is back with her ex . you need not explain how and when . just tell her you know and this ends here
arre but she'll ask . and create a scene . or ask her friends to ask me how i know
tell her you need not explain after what she has done . dont you want her out right away . why are you thinking so much
because i reallyg want to make her feel shit have my small nice revenge and move on happily . boltoh . see we're drunk rn so we'll brainstorm but if nothing that i agree to happens then i'll do this . i'm happy that even if it took twenty years for us to share stuff finally hogaya .  . ily . that's drunk me talking lol . but you understand what i'm saying
i want you to say this when you are sober
just tell what you have to because rn i'm not sad at all . i'm just vengeful . so in some way it's better
vengeful is even worse
but i don't want to let this slide . so yesterday was fun . i called her bs out and she denied it obviously . she didn't even tell her best friend in manipal everything . guess everyone was very surprised yesterday . and plus she is pretty disturbed in the head . and also she doesn't know that i logged onto her insta . so it's perfect . i'm finally happy happy . she found out that i logged onto her insta tho . pray that i don't land up in jail for cyber crime
that just forget this chapter and move on  ! . now
yep trust me thats the plan . last semester hai idhar . dont need no negativity anywats
exactly . study hard and get a kick ass job .nothing else matters
. bolde
aree nai ek fwd tha . lalita dagliya
whose is it
then i was like not useful for you  . lalita bhua

ya .
my roommate is hooking up with a dentist . so naturally i went and showed her my tooth x-ray for a free checkup
n hows your tooth
needs cleaning and cavity filling
get that done too
don't sleep till i text you but i will text you tonight that's for sure . the thing is i really want to stay in mumbai for next sem because so many functions . and i have had missed too many fucking functions . i love my family . but this company is for plavememts . meaning only after btech (after may) . and i can't stay after btech in mumbai
i think you should focus on quality of job for internship and after btech and not the location . you can take a few days leave for function
i need you stay it aloud because money is also a big thing . i can get a ctc of 30l in bangalore
dont think about money because  this is only for a year at max and then you will go for further studies . a good relevant job will help you get a good college
thank you i love you . i'll let you know what i do . sleep now . gn  . i love you jheal
love you too jenu . take care  . good night
i'm drunk fyi .
i know
chal soja
yes . you too sleep . all the best
thanks i love you again
love you too
deciding to tank the interviews m . can't sell myself for this cheap
think otherwise directly going to study is also a good option
yes but it's kinda late for that since applications have already started . and i haven't started anything for those procedures . i want to want to get work exp
so then go for the interview . why are you getting so confused . decide one thing and then work on it
job par work kar hi raha hu . but not this company . i had a video call interview and i acted so dyslexic
lol
man this company is such a joke . i don't even want it and i tried to tank it but still hr round happened and kinda went well . like they didn't ask proper questions fuckk . so irritating . called by mistake
thik hai na if you dont want you have an option right
but then i can't sit for placement for other companies ! . like if you get an offer you're out of the process
ohh aisa
one company is coming with 30l ctc !
n good work  ?
they weren't clear about that but i have the prerequisites
okay . your call .
so one of my friends wants an 8th job internship followed by full time work as a business yst at pwc . do you know who to contact
8th job  ?
8th semester job
whats the department hes looking for . business yst is no such thing
arre your seniors have no connection to the tech dept kya ? like the other offices of owc . pwc
we dont deal with them so no . n i told u there is no internship in that dept

"man i was coming home on a two wheeler and auto rammed into me . i didn't fall because i wasn't fast . like i just stopped stationary . index finger came between brake and auto ki body . i thought i was fine so side mai restaurant tha people helped me by giving ice . but since i was in shock, when i applied ice i just blacked out . like i woke 10s on the floor . one stitch mili . i was supposed to get two but the fucking intern literally lost my skin . like she ripped it apart with her needle . fyi this was directly after my exam so i can assure you i was sober . eh entertaining day"
blacked out  . n you were alone or was there someone with you  ?
arre shock mai i got cold na . so that biologically always happens
ohh ok
my classmate was coincidentally there toh she took me to the hospital then roommates came
ok  . you seriously are one tragedy
theek hai ab matlab aadat si hai . like i was thoda low in the hospital . nikal ke i was like ab toh har roz ka hai
lol  .its ok it happens  ! nothing to be low . par thoda aur dhyan se chala
dhyan see chalaya isliye sirf itna hua . my daily sugarcane juice wale uncle is like auto driver ka kya karna hai  . because it happened in front of him
oh ok
hello . finally at least ek confirm internship mili . dikat hai . there is no salary . and it's in melbourne
oh thats good . but why no salary  ?

it's research no . toh ek paper agar publish hogaya you masters me liye mast . and the job after that is also in the same field . i'm too hyped for it except the money oart . we still haven't gotten all the info so let's wait for that
oh ok

accha sun
haan bol
nothing this is a different topic . i have a three day holiday from exams . so i'm thoda tipsy  . have you  ? like in amsterdam or somewhere ?

one are you sure
yes
which sangeet group is that man
cousins ka
i won't be in mumbai na
are haan . bol de usko personal chat mein . internship ka kuch hua  ?
leave all that . i'll let you know . important discussion . i kinda fucked up . majorily
kya kiya  ?
so i bought 1g of strains when i came to mumbai with school people . legit a tiny bit was left so i just shoved in really inside my wallet and hid it pretty well . like you can't find it without actually looking for it . so i was talking on the phone today and she had it in her hand and she was like what is this and she said it smells weird also blah blah . i tried to take it from her to throw it but she said she'll throw it . so she'll mostly show it to dad too tonight . so yeah i kinda left the house
what the hell os wrong with you . why do you have it in the first place . are you fuckinng crazy . can you for once in life be sober . and not be attached to such stuff . i really am so disappointed in you
i have been for the longest time .
you drink and smoke all the time . thats what you do
manipal mai all this isnt there so i wanted to try after a long time  . i don't drink also itna anymore
what its not there . you are high all the time . and you msg me only when you are high . not otherwise . and i honestly dont know whats real
wtf . i don't !
its just the drunk you talking to me . who are you kidding
well i'm sober now can you please tell me what to do . don't talk to me like that please i'm not that gone case  . i swear to god jheal
there is nothing you can do now
i swear . dad will know na ?
why would you get that home  ?
arre it was just a small piece so i kept it very inside my wallet . which was in the cupboard
mil gaya na abhi
will u stop using it . u know how bad it is . n you are addicted . or before u get addicted
jheal addicts ko acche marks and naukri nahi milti hai
aree yaar u know what i am trying to say . week mein ek baar leta hai  ?
i swear it everything i do has not affected anything else in my life . even health . yeah okay this is true
i need not say anything else
what should i do with mom and dad
dont lie
even i was thinking that . but then any fuck up i do in the future sober also they'll say it's because of this . jheal your brother is not an addict or a smoker or an alcoholic and i need you to know that
ok i need to know that bcuz im not there with you and im just worried . i trust you . can u stop using it
i'd share all the troubles with you including relationship . off course yeh bolta if it was an issue . i do it only socially . you think i smoke alone in a room  . but yeah i'll decrease it . i'm glad manipal is over for this tbh
your socially is way too much
that's why i'm glad i'm outta that city .
ok decrease considerably . such that there is none found in your wallet in future
that's the plan i swear . that's why i wanna go to bangalore . thoda fresh start milega . never
dont start there as well . please
so they are turning a blind eye on it . i think i'm safe .
ok
jheal . reply asap . no trouble i have some exciting news . youll diee
bolo . kya hai  !
so j told you right that mom didn't throw my
yeah
guess who was high in the afternoon . mom . i could smell it on her . and then i sneakily checked . only half is left .
stop talking shit
i'm kinda 100 sure .
jenit just shut up . fuck off its not funny ok . you are really fucked up
man you're such a buzzkill . i'm telling you the truth . i don't have time for bullshit . i'm not that free in life . i thought you should know what your mom is doing as well . fuck you man . why will i talk about my mother like this . are you fucking stupid . chilati rehti hai
you are stupid . stop talking to me like that
".  . you started that . fine sorry . love you . starting fresh: . so jheal mom did really smoke it . i swear to god i knew exactly how much was there . because when i saw it in the drawer initially . i remember . and uska half hai . and mom was smelling of it . can you stop thinking this is a prank or whatever . and act like the older sister you're supposed to be and give a proper reply . and stop with your judging . i'm not having it . i'm old enough . tu aise treat nahi kar sakti . and like the grown up i'm, i'm texting my sister about it first before even talking to mom . reply when few . free"
you are stating it as a fact and making this an exciting news . do you think it is exciting
okay yeah fine sorry about that
had you told me this as a concern i wouldnt have replied the way i did . better
i've learned not to tell you everything so yeah i'll just be stating facts from now on since you don't like my personality :)
again there is a way
do you know mom wasis a stress smoker ? i am against cigarettes so yeah that's a proper concern
i just cant understand you
"explain karne ki try bhi nahi karunga . but she did , and i've never caught that . so i'm sure she does it very rarely and fucking chills out in life prolly whenever she does it . so yeah i'm kinda happy for her given how stuck she is in the house . all the time"
how do you know  ?
till date ive seen ash in her basin thrice when dad wasn't home . one was directly after a fight with dadi
n youve not told me that before
i've been trying to make our relationship chiller how its supposed to be at our age over the yearsm and all you've done is judge me for it . i don't need it from you and i don't deserve it . you treat me like that . so don't expect shit out of me . but anyway . give your thoughts on the info you just gotm
i can be very ok about stuff  ! but you know youve not been very easy . i am not judging you  ! i am just concerned and hence i try to explain you
you're too uptight because you never had this life during your ca . and it's fine . concern ki jab baat ayi hai you know i talk seriously . dikshita ka sab bataya . kyo . not judging you . that's all i've ever received from you man so leave that . i know how to handle our thing hence forth . mom ki baat chal rahi hai . woh bags . bata
fine jenit . do as you please
mom's thing say
ill handle it
no . i'm not being left out of a family thing . this is exactly what i'm talking aboutn . you can't even respect a twenty-one year old brother enough to include him in such a big thing . and then you're like oh i'm concerned blah blah . man dikshita was the most toxic shit i ever met . after the breakup i've actually really imoroved . this time naresh told mom and mom told me that jenit accha improve hogaya hai . so i'm trying to mend the way i've treated everyone at home . you clearly aren't helping me mend shit but excluding me .
ok sorry . i was just angry the way you texted . i shouldnt have spoken this way
blah blah chill hai . karna kya hai par
do you want to talk to her together  ?
not being rude . are you still concerned about the fact or more like want to know what's up  ?
ya of course want to know if shes ok
so this is a theory . i think she is normal in life . because this is not near the first time she's smoking up . nahi toh she wouldn't know how to consume it only . she definitely rolled it and smoked it or maybe dad did it for her . but given the time dad left and when i smelled it i'm sure she did it herself . but if she's like in a long term depressed state then idk but that's far fetched . so i think she's also using it recreationally
lets not assume stuff . and talk to her
"okay so i came up with this plan that over the weekend you come talk to her . you tell her that jenit knew you didn't throw it . and he smelled it and he knows half is missing so don't lie . and then talk supportingly and not like how you talk to me . and save my ass if needed . sounds good ? . do it over the weekend when i'm not at home . and tell her that seeing how she did it in the middle of the day, we know it's not her first time ."
ok
don't throw me under the bus please . will you talk to jiju about this ?
yes re . no
"okay just one advice to like change your mind thoda, since you're not even telling your husband about it, stop treating only  as cocaine and think of it more like wine . but yeah i understand because it's thoda internal family"
listen im really open minded so you dont need to tell me about changing my mind
cool . say no more . we straight
trying stuff is different and doing it on a regular basis is different
agree
whats your plan for tmrw night  ? . in town  ? . ki panchgani you were saying
i'm in aamby rn . atb lol . make sure you tell her it's fine and she can do it control if it's actually only for recreational about it . and not depression and stuff . and this i want from my parents fyi . you tell your point as well
im not ok she doing it  ! bcuz i know its not for recreational stuff . n first of all this is second to come . let me first know if she does it or not . which i doubt she does  ! . so step back
cool so you're in that mood . cool . mai pagal hu theek hai
what mood  ?
yeah you're not open minded for shit
are i dont believe unless i see it
mai badi hu meko sab malum hai tu chup kar type wala mood
its depressing and hence im not open to it  !
i won't say 100 until i mean it . yeah clearly not open mi ded . cool
im not doubting what you saw  ! its suprising and not sunk in . whatever  !
bye man i don't want to talk about this shit and ruin my mood taling to you
you are the one who is acting snobbish . i just told you something generally . you started with the mood thing . you be happy with your friends like always
telling and shoving your opinion isn't in cool by me . yep and at home with mom like in this vacation and everyone else . you deleted this message
i read that  !
cool
seriously bye
