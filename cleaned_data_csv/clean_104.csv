you girls talk about feminism and yet can't stand up for yourself . dikshita has decided to tell your parents about yesterday . how about she does that ? . then i'll apologise how much ever you want . you stop talking to such low lives . itne achhe ghar ki ho . doctor bhi ho ! and you want to disappoint your parents in such a way . hey . vidushi !
yup
hi . i assume you know whats happening
i'm sorry i dk . wat happened  ?
that dikshita broke up with me ?
oh okay  .i dint know please .she had told me about it  .but idk wat decision she took  .
cna you just tell me whatever you know . and please don't tell her we spoke
oh okay . i will speak to her once she is back . she is abroad now so i dint . talk much
but what did she tell before
she was happy dat u were coming to delhi . last i heard dat only about u from her
. you didn't know about the break up ? . did she say anything regarding that ?
no nothing
okay . please help me once she comes back . i love your sister and can't afford to lose her at any cost . i know i fucked up here and there and i'm ready to make up for everything . please help once she's back . i'm sorry i'm begging to you for help but desperation gets the best of us . you know how much i love dikshu . i just cannot leave manipal without her by my side .
okay . idk actually wat has happened . i'm not talking to her as of now  .as she is away .let her come back den we will talk mostly
ha . let her enjoy the vacation . even i'm trying my best to not overwhelm her when she's having fun . arre the same thing from last semester . that boy i threatened . you know that right ?
okay yes i know . don't worry evrything will be fine  .
she can't move past that . i thought we were healing from that and yet she's stuck there . vidushi please help me  . jaan hai woh ladki meri
ya she spoke about it . many times after she came . once she was crying and talking about it at night
what did she say
she has even told dad about it . she never tells dad stuff  .but she has repeated the whole thing many times
like what exactly did she say . how bad she was feeling about it ?
she says i'm fed up of all dis . my whole semester was ruined because of dis . i can't handle all dis . nobody wants to speak to me because of dis . no one likes me
vidushi mere liye it was so inappropriate . woh ladka uske birthday par usko messages bhej raha hai saying youre my diamond blah blah
den i asked wat about divya . she said only she talks
divya talks properly . dikshita doesn't give bhav to the girls because she thinks it's too much effort . she's distancing herself from the people who love her . and crying because people who don't care about her don't talk to her
oh okay . oh  .
pranjal cares for her true . but the other guys in the class stopped talking to her because they chose pranjal over her after the thing
ohkay i understood dat
she blames me for the other guys as well
oh . yaa i know . dikshu is completely opposite of wat i am . a lot of discussion happened about u . and i told her u really love her
when . she said all this only no ?
dats all was the conclusion when mom i and dikshu went out . however she was in two minds at dat time
what about me being insecure wala part
den she may have taken a decision . yes she said u r very insecure . however she shall do wat she wants she said . she loves u but she can't take all dis all the time  .
vidushi but you know shes too naive no . she says that he takes all my guy friends away without telling the reason why . did she tell you about saurak and parth and how she wants to reconcile with them ?
no no . idk . how was it in delhi . i thought u ppl were enjoying der . and u had plans . she said u r going clubbing
okay you didn't hear this from me . but it is very necessary that you know that . saurak and parth were the people who could have helped her when she got molested . and they didn't do shit and moreover they kinda chose the molester over her . so i told them to stay away from dikshita and me . and dikshita is like they didnt do anything and i don't make friends to want something in return hence i want to talk to them . if as a bf i can't protect her from such people then what good am i . and i'm getting the bossy bf name because i told her to not talk to such people ! how is that fair
idk when and how she got molested and by whom
i couldn't go there . worst decision of my life .
my parents have no clue as well
this was 4th semester . she doesn't like to talk about it .
oh god she was really waiting for u . she told me about it
i curse myself everyday . i really should have gone . about what
dat she was glad u were coming
oh okay . it's okay evrything will be fine once she is back . i really donno the whole story so . who molested her  ?
remember her friend anirudh ?
yes . i think so
dikshita was sleeping at my place when her german exam was there . i left manipal so she was in my room . that night saurak and anirudh got drunk . saurak went to his room and passed out and anirudh went to my room when dikshita was sleeping and grabbed her butt . luckily she got up kicked him and ran into the bathroom and that was that . still after this incident saurak and parth didn't do shit to stand for dikshita and dikshita wants to make up to them . as a bf how can i allow that vidushi you tell me . i've tried my best to be a good bf . i can't do better .
my god dis is just i have no words . i know dat i can understand
is she staying in delhi after coming back ?
no no . she will be back home
should i come to kolkata . or should i give her space and wait for manipal
i'll have to speak to her . when do u ppl have to be back  ?
she's leaving on the 21st . dikshita shouldn't know you know this or she's going to never forgive me for sure
no no . i just called her . i dint tell her anything . she plans to enjoy with vedant vatsal after she comes back
accha . doesn't make sense for me to come there . did you talk to her ? . bataoo
she is busy with vedant vatsal
i think mahiman is poisoning her ears
oh . i really donno she is busy with pubg and wat not
please talk to her please . pubg won't be the reason of you not talking to her . if you don't want to interfere then please say so . i won't bother you after that
we haven't got a chance to speak  .let me see  .will let u know tonight
she came two days ago . looking at her behavior she definitely spoke more to mahiman than you spoke to her .
true  .
please tell me if you're planning to speak to her cos if you're not then i don't want to keep hopes high . i'm tired of being disappointed
i wont be able to talk sorry  .
"then say that first instead of this bs . next time by any chance if i try to stand up for your rights, remind me i'm being stupid okay ?"
the irony of the situation is to save your relationship u need oder ppls help  .to save mine i dint need anyone  . irrespective of who the guy is for me .dat is the way i am dat is the way i love and care for someone  .dat he can never leave me and go  .and today u stand here  .waiting for someone  .however u have no idea wat future holds in store for u  .good luck  .i said ill try but now i won't  .i'm not mahiman and i'm not vedant vatsal  .but if i want something to happen it happens  ! .be it in my sister's life as well  .anyhow soon she will be in manipal  . i dint want dat u ppl interfere but still u did  !i don't bother much about past things because i know everything will fall in place  !
you do you
