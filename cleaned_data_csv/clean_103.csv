iske ghar se mast hagke nikla
"you prick go look at instagram asap . your endorsement is vital . just like our comments and comment """" . bohot hai"
cool
cool what
sorry what were you saying . elaborate
you better show him the screenshot i sent on the group . threaten the shit out of him . give me this naveen's number
i sent the other guy that toh he would have conveyed the info . nahi hoga
i got eleven lakhs for my birthday from my grandfather . we can buy the company
rn we either actually file the complain or just edit the doent . abbey lele jenit . pdf hai . use your editing skills and write something nice about yourself .
nah we do everything properly
this is what the guy said
no . that is not us . we don't bend before failures
mgk eminem jaisa hai . honestly we can just edit it . i feel khatam karo . doesn't make sense prolonging this bs
he started panicking and then blocked me .  . he actually panicked
kept insisting that he's paid you . said it six times
should i tell him that he's the one who started this bs
he thinks he hasn't violated any law . no . straight up . he's made so many millions he feels the need to get insecure and block me
i'll just text him once . need to explain the kid before slapping him and be might just listen . chutiya
he won't listen . he's stuck up . dekh le
i've seen the price spreadsheet . ghanta nahi
tell him that
then we'll slap him . i'm not bringing money . i'm just gonna stick to the facts
your wish . dekh le . woh hila toh hua hai . but he still won't admit defeat . tell his friend that you're reporting bc you don't want to resort to photoshop
"i've sent him a text . based on the reply actually report kar lete hai . nahi suna bsdk . he got pissed because you texted  . you always piss him off more than me  . but legally, he gave a certificate right . so all we have is the screenshot"
no since he's threatened you that he'll spoil your certificate in the past . it's inadmissible . and the screenshots support that you did well . so it holds . i'm just wondering if you can report him without bringing up anything else . we'll have to come up w a way
what do you mean . let's just photoshop man
i can't stop you . but i don't support it . tera man hai
man if he goes to the university phir masters ke wande ho sakte hai
woh toh hai . but university will listen to you also . but scene toh hoga can't deny . you can even go to mumbai police tbh . they'll be more than happy to take care of him for you . they'll even give you immunity . dekh le bro . tera mann . i know it's not easy
man i'm done . find someone with photoshop skills now
ashwani ko bol . kar dega
. sort . he's like . uske baad koi insult likhe de .
chodh use
bc insult ka time aata hai toh ye bolta hai . chut
i'll personally take care of him after your placement . i don't believe in final say . i get even
pubg khelega ?
nahi
why'd you leave the whatsapp group . and how come i'm not following you in insta
i removed you bc you are not worthy . :p . baitha reh ab
sab bt do aaj
kal hi hata diya tha
my mom is treating me like a proper hangover patient even though she hasn't addressed anything remotely related to alcohol . kyu bc . and what about the whatsapp group . accha bata kya likhu certificate par . i'm getting it done now . oyee . is this fine
looks photoshopped . the h and r in marwah road is cropped on the top right . the spacing between sentences isn't equal in the first paragraph . also the address should start one line below to be directly opposite and central to the line on the left . physiz logo is cropped . also you will never talk to the guy who helped you out in the company . he has no business knowing whether you photoshopped your letter or not . if he asks
yes . do away ?
that you got one from your dad's company . redo the certificate nonetheless . while it's unlikely to be scrutinized the way i'm scrutinizing it
i'll get it redone . thanks man . dude . all this was fucked up in original pdf also . what should i do
wing it . they will first see the spacing between lines . doubt that and then look to the other things to decide if it's fake or not . leave the logo as it is . fix everything else
iska sab there hai upar ka
use it . and still bring the address one line below to align it
"woh ab nahi hoga, see in this also it's one line above"
you know that's how it is . someone suspecting forgery will see it as a discrepancy . dekh le tu
"theek hai . spacing in this is fully justified and not left ident, so uneven spaces thing is fine . did you even understand what i was trying to say"
no i stopped reading . khola nahi ab tak . but no i won't listen
"man all i'm saying is that yes i know i lost . i agree . don't give me a hard time for it because you are one of the reasons it started too . moreover, stop patronizing me . tumlog se aisa expected nahi hai . i never said you lost too, we would have won if we did everything you said, true, but thoda realistic baneka"
thoda stress le life mei and jeet ke dikha . rather than being afraid of taking it far . nothing worthy comes easy
"like you said, college ke internship se  ghanta kuch nahi hota . doesn't make sense risking even the minimum for this bs . aage jake sab karege . me closing down a company with your help whose capital is less than what either of spend in a short time isn't worth jack . i'm not even of the age where my stress should include courts, cases, imprisonment of anyone . bc exams dedu acchese kafi hai"
dude i don't care mujhe kyun bata raha hai . we didn't even say anything that you bent over for him . we said it bc of you saying that he learnt a lesson too . faltu khwaab na dekh usne jhaat nahi seekha . bas utne ke liye suna tu
i just meant about the not sharing s with interns part . i specified that also . tu zyada karleta hai . dekh le kya kya bola hai
bc i'm confident i can win . no win comes from a smooth road . but it's your life . i get it if you don't want to . but kisi din karna padega . chutiye se log tujhe push karte hain aage kya hoga
i know bhai par only i'll have to face the repercussions  na . i don't mind that day . two months ki internship ke liye kyu time waste karna hai . chill karna . i've been thankful for all you've done . it's just that you need to start controlling your mouth .
i really won't . not even a bit
theek hai phir kya bolu tujhe
there is a place to shutup . and that place wasn't it . woh ladka kuch bhi bol raha tha and tu sun raha tha . i'm not even slightly sorry for what i said
okay you misunderstood me .
i'm only sorry that we didn't shut him
not shut up to him . you should see what you were telling me . on the group . uska soch ke bolneka
"i meant every word . if you can't go all way, don't commit in the start"
"to him, even i'm not . i had a good laugh . worth every penny"
"nothing that i do is conventional . conventional ends up average . average is middle class . not good enough . my sister is like you gets pushed around, school jaakar dhamkaya they sucked my toes on the s"
haan theek hai . it's not like you lost anything . so why condescend for the sake of doing so .
kutton ke saath insaan ki tarah baat nahi kar sakte
you already know i lost and uske baat tera bhi sunu . chutiya nahi hu
haarna apni jagah hai
tera waisa tone apne pas rakh
haar na maana bakchodi hai
"losing a small meaningless battle with a twat so that nothing crucial is risked is totally fine by me . chutiya koi acchi cheez bigad de, woh zyada bura lagega . woh soch"
ab woh ladka one hundred aur ladkon ka kaatega . aaj jeet ke
abbe par uski aukad utni hi rahegi na . long term phir bhi woh hi harega na . mussolini hai sala
mei toh uska business khareed ke rahunga . i haven't given this up . this is not over by a longshot
"dekh i havent objected for anything you've done to him or said . i'm just saying mere se tameez se baat kar thoda . hasi mazak sab side mai, know to draw a line sometimes . i'll chip in also . masters ka admission hone de . phir dollars mai kharedege . dslr la payega ? . duty free se ?"
i'll ask my dad kya scene hai . i'm buying an iphone for ashwani and carrying a rolex for my dad . so kaafi kuch already hai . if they catch one i'll have to pay duty on everything
chal theek hai . what time you coming by . iska price sirf check karlena airport par
that's not even a dslr lol . scam
why
it's a point and shoot
also when are you coming
don't know . monday se internship hai
exams ?
i don't know if they'll have it in jan . might be after the internship
oh that late okay . what do you keep telling priyanka . she keeps feeling hurt because you say stuff
man let her know it's pointless to try getting me to come around . na mei kisi ke liye budge karta hoon na usme woh baat hai
. i told her to not talk to you . sunti hi nahi hai
she made mahima video snap me explaining sahoo's side of the story lol . she doesn't even understand i don't even have an actual problem w her i just ed her out by process of elimination
.
what did she tell you today . dikha
snapchat ka ha . i . so can't screenshot
kya boli
rona . why is he doing this and all . he hates mr . rudhran hates me
she thinks it's bc of the mahima thing but i was talking to her for months after the mahima thing

60k points ?
yeah . ready ho
yes wait . loading g
aaja . dude exit your squad . kidhar gaya
aa . you deleted this message . you deleted this message
you landed in bombay ? . bro my flight's on time . uth bc . bro . but if you beg in this moment then you'll turn her conviction solid . rn she needs time off for her mind to balance out her feelings . i know this is huge for you and a nightmare . any act on impulse will only harm this for you . speaking from experience . lubaba bhi mera kaati thi three saal baad mei bhi roya tha instead of taking charge and aaj tak regret karta hoon . roz sapna aata hai ki uska instagram verify ho gaya and mere discover pe aa rahi hai
she's like i refuse to learn long distance and she can't go through it again and she doesn't asking formpermission from me . kaha permission yaar . molesters me saath bahar jayegi . idk what to say react feel think
"okay look . after all people do change through their years in college, you may not be the same people you were when you first met . but right now, do not act on impulse . there is absolutely nothing that you can do that time can't"
but we changed and grew together man . i've already a cepted this
"man it's not even her, girls for some reason can't think for themselves . it's always a group effort . mummy kuch aur bolegi . best friend kuch aur bolegi . and ladki convince ho jayegi . and nothing that you say can help that . the only thing you can do is use time to specifically trigger her feelings . honestly it's a really fucked up mind game that people look down upon but that doesn't mean it doesn't work . and there are very real ways to trigger a girl's feelings . but you'll have to take the time to do those things"
i can't go through that phase . i was supposed to marry this girl . we knew how many kids we were gonna have
when she posts something
i know location of our marriage . and iske baad i'm expected to trigger feelings
start typing on snapchat and never send anything . man these things work . all you have to do is stay relevant and trigger her within short bursts of time to maximize thoughts about you in her alone time . that's the only way to undo what a girl hears from her surroundings . it's basically a science man it may sound stupid but manipulating a brain is the best way to get anything done . just take the time for it . i can't say anything to make you feel better about this
not much left for me so might as well
"you know how you ask why a guy like me gets as much fanatical love . it's because i don't let them forget me . it's honestly sick, the way i do it . but if you use it right then it's not a bad thing at all . remember that someone manipulates her thoughts is why this happened . so nothing that you can say will undo that, only your return moves will . hell even i'll post pictures w you late in the night to flash on her screen"
she's like no . that just mean she really has been giving a lot of thought to this
"do you think it's realistic that all of it is her original wish ? . i'm actually asking, not being condescending"
she has been saying how much last sem affected her and how she can't get over it . multiple times . and this vacation she barely texted
man sometimes people just get put off by routine
half things i found from her snapchat
"and in those moments any feelings that help manifest their feelings they hold on to . so if she's bored of something, she'll keep telling herself how it's not right . and if you beg her into trying again, she'll spend the next few weeks feeling trapped and you'll be fighting again when you return . take this time off for now . all break ups are just a break in the start nothing is certain . the events that lead it help decide it's permanence . if anything, be glad it's happened at the end of summer when she doesn't have enough time to manifest her thoughts . ek text pe three saal ka relationship nahi khatam hota . even lubaba and i talked for a year after breaking up and we had enough chances to fix everything . tera bhi time aayega but it's not today . when i broke up w madhurima last sem . she could have changed that but she helped aggravate whatever i thought right from the start"
makes sense . thank you
impulse mei kuch mat karna because you will spend your final year cursing yourself if you know ki tune khud se kaata
yep treading carefully
sahi . and galti se bhi gaali mat dena
obviously
talk to her like mahima talks to everyone . and don't gain weight . breaks your case when the time comes
?
abey mera bohot make up hote hote kata because i had gained weight by then :p . remember they will want to hold on to anything negative they can find . first negatives are the things they can physically see . regardless of how stupid the thing would be
cool
agle poore hafte mast vodka peeke teri yaad mei bt legi . usko bt hone de
i fucking hope so
hanuman chalisa seekh iss time pe . bhagwaan ka bulawa aane ke alag alag tareeke hote hain
actually thought about this
bhagwan made you think about it . don't ignore it . pooja paath karne lag . also don't tell anyone about your break up yet
ik
no science behind it but mera maanna hai hai ki honi se pehle dhindora peet ke bhi bad-dua lagti hai
she's like i don't feel the same way for you as you do for me
bhai bolne de . this is pure routine fatigue . when you think you want something else and not being able to try aggravates your feelings
but her being able to say this bluntly is a big thing
"maybe it will become permanent over time, if she starts feeling liberated in the next few days . this is why i said kuch bhi ho gaali mat dena and be gentle . because bohot trigger hota hai ye time pe . when you want to say shit back . but that's as far from helping yourself as it can be . jo bol rahi hai take it w incredible grace . make her see a side of you she didn't know existed . even if it is fake :p . they are not as strong as they think and we are not as weak as we thing, the one who plays their cards with a stable frame of mind will be the one to win . star mark karde"
man i don't understand girls . jo chaiye woh batayege nahi
if you did toh hum agency kholte
jo karna hai bolege nahi
abhi zyaada baat bhi mat kar . iss moment mei discussion is futile
yeah she took off
carry on w your day as you would . kal hota break up toh mujhe kuch karne ko hota bombay mei . gandi si chaul mei so raha tha mc
"i don't really know what to do now onwards . i've done everything fucking right, good or bad, that a fucking brilliant bf would do . puri life hilana na pad jaye"
"love yoself . hum choice se hilaate hain . use this time to discover tinder . mast photos laga . bas menu dekhna, kuch order mat kar dena bc"
i can't
can(t) . chal tdm khel . bt mei baith ke kya hona hai
chal bc kuch karne ko hi nahi

"wohi toh . arav bhi when he came, he came w the same attitude . that today i'll sign and aage dekhunga . i know eshan will do the same thing . and i know the repercussions of that"

exactly . 13k ka kya hua
i want to book on world's fastest zipline for this weekend . dad said he'll pay in the evening but i don't have time
tell me the name . because honestly i'm done with zipline . 13k ki kya hai bc  . let me see
six hundred dirham ki 2 . bro done . book ho gaya . man remember i told you i think harshit's case will take a few years to finally close
what about it
kundli hi kharaab nikli
you forwarded the info for this ? . but mostly he'll be in rather than out right
"yeah harshit gave . my dad sat for hours . said it's a tricky kundli . said unki kundli mei likha hai that for one second's brain deflection that he'll commit hera pheri, he'll get caught up in it . he's not someone who can take those risks . he can't say for sure exactly how much time he's going to spend in jail . but he says there's not a lot of peace of mind for the next 5-7 years"
aisi cheeze chalti toh hai kafi time . fucks . atleast he's in delhi
he showed me why on the software
ek acchi cheez
it actually shows the planetary movements in relation to your life . you could pretty clearly see that this current period extends into a few years
don't know how much i believe in it but one thing for sure is this
for sure kuch nahi hota hai . log apni kismat badal bhi lete hain . but yeah idk how . i can't do international transfers or use my cards because no pan . i'll try getting it done through arav or shringi or someone else asap gimme a bit
cool keep me updated . accha he asked me samnese about the payment today
yeah man bt ho rahi hai itne din ho gaye . yesterday i asked someone in india to arrange . karke dega thodi der mei . i'm hoping he does it by saturday but i'm not confident he will so i'm talking to shringi also . shringi can pay immediately but don't want to take that liability . if my guy doesn't pay him on time then shringi atak jayega
bro ticket ke kafi din hogaye so i suggest do this . you'll be meeting him soon enough anyway no . like start of jan when you get back . dhirams chuppa de :p
yeah but i don't want to tell him i'll pay him next week
but you see
i have money rn . i have it bro
yeah yeah
i got 60k a few days ago . for hong kong
i'm just telling you the dynamics lol . yeh kab hai bc
eighteen march . mostly even shringi is coming
lol
i'm covering him mostly . expecting some investments to bring returns by feb end . if enough returns then i'm covering him and arav if he gets his passport
and my rent
that's already done . two month's behind on rent but the rest of it's been arranged
behindm .  ?
june rent and december rent is yet unpaid . i've only made arrangements for total of three months so far . baaki bhi hoga tab dekhenge . it's just 400 a month so i'm not too concerned
bro man mere rent ka samaj nahi as raha hai . because according to me june was paid . only december onwards wasn't . i'm very confused . because i was owed also so much money . and then harshit ki tickets karai
tune diya june jo paid hoga ? :p
and still if i owe rent for june and december then it's a problem . no i'm saying we paid something . because i got enough money for rent till like feb or something including harshits and all
"harshit ki tickets i paid you for . remember when you left, i told you that i'll owe you 4k when you leave"
there is no way we spent itna . ha
so on splitwise you owe me some 3200 . when that reaches 4k . then we'll be settled
accha
then other than that . you do still owe your share of june and december . june i'll still take from deposit no way i'm paying . others i'll pay . we'll probably cover all your rent till the end and take it from your deposit later
bro i don't understand itne debt that people owed me kum kaise hogaya
"bro har mahine ki bijli . last month arav paid, then last week i paid"
okay this i remember
sathish . ram . grocery
i kept paying him my thing bro
i think arav paid ram for you
all these yes but are small
recently after you left
bro ram called me and told me he didn't get shitb . for this also he said it was unpaid
how much does arav owe you ?
"and even if it was, fine . but itne mahina ka rent coukdnt have been coveredb . just 2 .5"
bro i remember you telling me a week before leaving how you've spent 15k in a short amount of time . and i remember telling you that expense was yours
yes
because tu hi roz bahar ja raha tha sab log ke saath . 15k on it's own is two months' rent
bro i remember my split being beautiful and then not beautiful
calculate kar where you spent
and this was finen . only one thing i'm very doubtful is . the 9ish k that was written in my notepad . the one you owed harshit . you sure we settled here ? . yeh toh nahi hoga but yeah splitwise is fine
"yeah bro, i came from lucknow and paid rent"
accha fine cool . except the november electricity where we paid 2 .2k each and we barely stayed for half month and woh bhi apan shringi me that zyada the . abbe itni kitni electricity use karta hai arav :p
i owed you around 10k because of harshit and our own hisaab and then i paid your rent . aisa kuch nahi be
yeah yeah fine i won't ask now chill hai
bijli sabka hi hai
. yeah that's why didn't say much
if that full month we stayed then we have equal responsibility to bill
not full electricity cycle
the bill we paid last week was upto november 15th . november 15th-december 15th is still unpaid . so 1k
arre bc
just 1k man
november 15th tak was added on split before only na but
recently . arav added it
yeah but i'm just gettingnonntop of things because that time i didn't have split . j thought that was . this .
"chill, i remember it :p . you'll just have to take my word for it lol . nahi"
yeah man shouldn't have lost my phone
"if that was the case . then mahine bhar pehle bijli nahi cut hoti . we got two months backlog, then arav paid one month, they restored, then i paid second month . now this is the new bill"
arav jab baap see gali khaya tha that was oct nov bill ?
oh wtf
then i paid last week
ohh
now we owe we paid this is november end
"fine fine . chill hai phir yeh . arghh . i hope ill be able to save and keep sending every month thoda . so yesterday the 5k thing, dad figured it out and paid it . and then he was going through gpay app . gand phat gayj baap ki . he's like kya mast hai bri ."

nice . go save 35k . and come . fuck rent
"yols . accha side note, i've ask my friend time till sunday . please tab tak jugaad :p . fuck bro hopefully after earning life aisi gareebi mai na jaye"
"gareebi mei nikli phir itni padhai ka kya phaayeda . kaam kar apna chup chaap and risk le life mei . bakchodi mei mat baitha rahe ki door nahi jaana, parents nahi maanenge etc . do everything necessary"
dads not saying . im saying . see bro do it asap . yes yes
my dad's biggest advantage over his peers was his willingness to get uncomfortable in any strange land and work there . yeah man i get it . i don't fucking owe people this is bt . especially bc shringi and arav were actually supposed to pay him immediately but shringi delayed payment by a week after which arav used it to pay electricity . ruk gaand se nikalwaata hoon paisa uski
bahut kamaya isliye touch wood chalta rahe
i paid shringi's poker debt the day after you left
wtf
usme phir hage ye dono log
he had that too ? !
yeah not a lot . some 6-7k . i paid 5k . and i paid electricity to arav plus he needed spending money so i gave him that too . nahi dena chahiye tha in hindsight . not to mention this was a week after covering full rent yet again . bc bohot ghisa mei khud ko ye semester saalon . for no reason xd
mere bhi kidhar udgaye
now he owes me more than the ticket amount lol
need to keep everything in account
at least i know where mine went :p . yeah
auto ke forty rs dalata that 2nd year tak walnut par
tere jaise bakchodi mei mere nahi doobe paise :p
yols . one last time
abhi when i go back arav phir bt dega over rent . god i hope he has his own share
bro start stealing foreign currency mai . zaroorat hogi hi hogi
funny you said that . naveed and i are starting our own business . wasn't gonna tell anyone
but it's been in the works for a while . he's in the process of getting his forex license right now . and i don't need one
? ?
his business aent is stronger than all of my friends combined . kabhi dimaag mei business idea aaya bhi hai jo has raha hai gandu ? . we start trading january 27th
i thought you were joking . punchline ka wait kar raha tha . but what exactly
and will only incorporate once capital valuation reaches 40000
currency exchange thing ?
forex upto 40000
incorporate what ?
then incorporate into investment sector in africa . entially looking at rwanda . will have to shift there after college too
oh man
remember the billionaire who came over for dinner a few days ago that i snapped ?
ha
owns yum brands africa franchisee . he's guiding me in the african space because i told him i don't need his capital . but i know he'll invest on his own otherwise it isn't worth his time
ego pe liya hoga lol . but what exactly you doing
"have to decide on first investment . still looking at options . in rwanda, they have 100 export of coffee . no local demand . and very pro-fdi policies . so we're looking at selling bulk to hotel chains . for the first investment, then we'll see how that goes . naveed is leaning towards importing in africa which is quicker money but also heavily regulated . so we're exploring both options"
in india ? . and initial money kaha se ?
"i'm only interested in one business in india atm . and that's import, sales and servicing of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure . and that industry is still 3-4 years away . so not thinking about that right now . mutual funds liquidate karke . thirty-two lakh mere paas hai, naveed has twenty-five lakhs"
but maybe better start now so you'll have an edge later and can afford to fuck up now when the industry isn't booming . but yeah no money making anytime soon then
just that he's lazy so he doesn't study as seriously as i do
oh shit
"no, there's no market there now"
talent catches up to the laziness eventually toh chill hai
you need to step in right when the govt mandates that manufacturers start selling a small portion of inventory as evs . and that legislature is a few years away
oh
canada will adopt it in next three years . india will take at least twice as long
toh tab tak you wanna import something that you can capitalise in the near future na (coffee)
small value goods with low insurance rates and high yield . so coffee
love that i understand this . nice man . kabse baat chal rahi hai ?
if you can come up with a way to bring property on the internet in rwanda then boy do i have a market for you . few months . this is what i'd like to do but don't have the technical know-how
property in the internet . matlab ?
"buy, lease, sell . property . put it on the internet . usse bhi zyaada bada market is for jeet's dad . which i will eventually consider . the fastest growing economy in africa also needs new housing . i want jeet to get into his dad's business once and then i'm gonna pull him in"
isnt uganda faster . bc zambia bhi legalise karliya  for economy
no one is as politically stable or focused on growth as rwanda
udhar karna chaiye apanko kuch
not even tanzania or south africa
ha those factors matter
"today to make money, you'll have to go where no one wants to go because everywhere else is saturated . that's why i was telling you, the more you think about your obligations, the slower you'll grow . go out there and do anything necessary"
woh toh hai
"we're considering north africa, saudi arabia and kuwait at the moment"
for import ?
saudi in general has too much to offer . in saudi and kuwait both i'm interested in ev import and servicing . along with hopefully have a monopoly on charging . saudi also has an upcoming tourism industry . but yes . next year at this time we may very well be living in rwanda . or planning the move
charging what ?
the cars xx
bro best case scenario bc kaun jata hai udhar . udhar jakar yeh sab kiya toh nothing like it
that's the point
only charging mai bhi monopoly hai : . exactly
"not many asian nations can either . every year rwanda grows twice as fast as the biggest economies in africa . that's why it matters to have worldly knowledge, so you can identify opportunities . tell anyone you're going to rwanda odds are they've either never heard of it or they'll tell you you're stupid bc kaun jaata hai . abhi kaam karo sab log 1-2 saal . kuch saal mei i'll figure a way out to bring everyone together . frankly if the situation in hong kong sees rapid deterioration over the next few years, then that in itself will be an opportunity for my business"
the latter for sure . sab itna sasta ho jayega . desh chud toh gaya hai kafi . tu chalu kar waise bhi youve invested time in this and terese normal job zyada hoga nahi . yeh sab se hi tu upar pauchega . bhai kaustubh jab first time india ke bahar jayega soch is kaam ke wajarse nikle . yeah we are definitely earning some money together in the long term future . phir manipal ki bakchodi 25saal purani sharab peekar baat karege
yeah i need kaustubh in africa . he has something none of us do . is ability to work on the ground
koi nahi kar sakta bc
kaustubh jaayega khet mei farmer se ladne ki yield kyun nahi aa raha . i won't do that
yeh slavery wapas layege business ke liye africa mai
anyway . these plans will take years to materialise . but yes there is real ential provided everyone does their bit
when are you planning to initiate anything but
january end . i'm making naveed study right now . i'm trying to arrange 1700 cash bc i don't want to sell shares rn . naveed already has his 1700
nahi but first kaha se chalu karega ? . import of coffee se ?
trading account . min of one thousand dollars each . then trade forex till we have 40k
"three thousand, four hundred to 40k mai kafi time chalejayega"
i want to have 20000 combined between us when brexit finally takes shape . that's my first opportunity
. uski date postpone hoti rehgi
on that day pound will drop and i will buy one ton of indian rupees . not to mention that both jeet and kaustubh's dad are in construction . so if jeet licenses his name to kaustubh . kaustubh can take loans under his dad's company for construction projects in rwanda on jeet's companies name . jeet will get licensing fees and kaustubh will get to legitimately grow his dad's business . not to mention you can import cheap textile from africa . all of us have a lot to offer that we haven't even realised . i'm going to tap into all of that
bro fuck tab khudke paisa hoga remind me . won't make sense . textiles are down in asia . already over production hai
lol then we won't do that
but yeah
for me . i see more point growing in africa with africa
sirf padhna padega sab mucj
rather than the usual foreigner approach to taking resources
lol so true
"that's why housing development is important to me . because you prove the concept in one broke country . and all the other broke countries will beg you to do it for them . which leads to all kinds of subsidies, tax exemptions and amazing loans"
bhai kaustubh ka karana hai somehow ek din . itna ential hai . phir bhi 3k pm ke tuitions de raha hai . like fine good enough for now . but clearly not remotely good enough for bim
with his degree . his life may actually remain in mediocrity unless he does something substantial with conviction . and woh job mei nahi hoga . usko business karna hoga . mujhe bhi
exactly
and together all of us are really strong . alone none of us are that capable is the first thing we must accept . i'm not either
ba man stupid fuck . man even i don't want to be stuck in a safe job . ghumkar gand ghisni hai
"you and harshit and arav are actually the only current misfits in my plan :p . but i know that if the business grows then we'll have things for you, even if we don't today"
sorry man  .
bro thodi padhai karle and free time mei humaare saath forex paida kar . you can be a partner from day one
quantiphi gand ohad kar padhne di hai . but it's actually real world studies . aws wagera . seekne mil raha hai

bhai kitna effort daal raha hu 5k se kam toh kahi nahi . exactly what i said
"if we stay on track and actually work towards each milestone, then no one can stop us from having a combined wealth of a million before we reach 30 . the numbers don't allow anything else"
that's pretty possible . ah zyada sapne dikha diya . kaam karo ab
