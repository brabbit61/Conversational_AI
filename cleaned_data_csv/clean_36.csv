"isn't this the same thing https:forms.glejpb6yifymdpiy253a this is the link we got with this group dekh  was getting tired of his dubai trip
"
"hahaha i know man tera last message dekha and i was like jenit ladega aaj vidit se 
"
"i was happy when kaustubh replied ab nahi hoga
"
"ab bta vidit ne bada chada ke bola ya nahi? 
"
"let me read man my timing is wrong every fucking time yeh to achi story nikli 
"
"https:drive.google.comdrivefolders13vomv7dmxmwc6ytebfxjynhjdlpc-txk?uspsharing
"
"checking wait so the dataset is basically just the description of the movie like if the genre is one then that movie is part of that genre vice versa and the prediction is whether the movie wwas a success or not then the standard scalar function is used to normalise the dataset you deleted this message we need to do this because the columns from g to l are not in the range from -1 to one we do this scalar normalisation because we dont want any one feature to affect the model more. like if the votes are in millions and the genre is just zero or 1, change in the number of votes will affect the output more because it is such a big value so thats why you just normalize all features you deleted this message clf  svm.svc() this is basically creating two different models using the training set and getting the predictions on the test set confusion matrix in this case is a 22 matrix basically the principal diagonal elements should be as large ass possible and the other elements should be as less acc1  accuracyscore(ytest,ypredsvm) this is self explanatory precision and recall are two performance measures. i dont really understand the significance of either but f1 score is calculated as f1  two  (pr)(pr) higher f1 is better basicall
"
"damn need some time to understand all this fuck ek baar laptop pe tum kar run kar and fir call kar please
"
"arre bata toh sahi kya hua isme mera internship ka run chal raha hai isliye abhi nahi kar sakta
"
"dont understand these values also jab test file run karta hoon tab error ata hai free hoke raat mein call karliyo but please karliyo kal subh submission hai
"
"accuracy is just number of wrong predictions precision and recall ka formula dekh false positives are those instances where the model predicts the output as one (movie is successful) but actually the movie wasn't successful this is your two by two matrix that is printed so one hundred and sixty-two movies which werent successful, the model also predicted it wasn't successful and accuracy  (16227)(162271110)  correctly predictedall 0.9
"
"prediction using svm and prediction using logestic regrrssion ka kya scene hai? all the 0s and 1s .. also what does actual mean in this? actual yes and actual no
"
"basically jo test set mai instances hai, according to svm model all the movies were not successful, and according to logistic regression only the first two movies were successful. number of elements in that prediction list is basically the number of elements in the test set xtest see the test set is part of the csv file for which we know the output. so the given output is the actual output, andthe predicted one is predicted by the svmlr classifier given only the input
"
"the total number of movies in the training csv is one thousand yeh thirteen kyun dikha rha hai? out of which total successful movies are seven hundred and seventy-two according to the csv file. last column
"
"nevermind, this is happening on check.csv
"
"ohhhhh got it got it 
"
"why is this your lab proj
"
"my lab instructor is chutiya guy who was very vague about the labs project requirements and shit so i just asked one of the guy doing the lab with me to get someone elses project that they did last semester yeh banda akhand chutiya hai hello world ke aage koi program nahi samjh sakta issliye im trying to understand this also, why this difference in result svm model and logistic se shouldnt they predict the same thing?
"
"different approaches to detect. svm basically forms a hyperplane in the n-dimension. so points on one side of the hyper plane are in one class and the other side are the other class
"
"acha last question
"
"logistic regression is more based on probability
"
"graph ka kya scene hai. how to interpret this auc graph mein accuracy hai? if so why is this 0.83 and neeche accuracy is 0.9
"
"bro just write the particular graph names on google. mujhe bhi interpretation and significance nahi pata
"
"this is the part that gets us those dots
"
"abbe ye random chutiyap hai. see the 6th and 7th column in x its just drawing a graph between two random features delete that part because there is actually no interpretation for that
"
"okay
"
"bro i checked ghanta twenty kill nahi hue uske
"
"kiske? i think you sent it to the wrong guy back-bircher bitcher
"
"abbe vidit likha na group par that uska bhi kal hur the after you sent the screenshot wala message thinf
"
"ohhh

"madarchod group par bheja chutiya

"you want to predict who will leave? also internship?
"
"yeah haanji type of employee who will leave like sales, marketing etc
"
"and for the why these employees, draw various graphs of features so you can see simple neural network use kar
"
"and then which employee specifically is prone to leave
"
"use keras for easy model
"
"hmm padhna padega iske baare mein.
"
"like features of an employee that will leave? barely the api is tooo easy
"
"i think they mean employee id or could be this too this is what all they want.
"
"3rd thing is the neural network for the other two draw graph using python for each feature for both the classes and see what you find so like if some values (one column) is small for all values in which the employee will leave, then that is the trend try to do that and see if you come to some conclusion if you dont see anything then tell i'm i'll think something different
"
"acha theek hai. btata hoon

"
"obviously
"
"bhai
"
"whats up?
"
"things dont look very good man. like dikshita doesnt text properly because shes visiting people and in kolkata also she was busy. so i brought up the matter and long story short shes like she cant put the facts of what happened last sem behind her and wants to take a break
"
"what the fuck are you okay?
"
"""i need to refresh myself, as this has been too much on my mind"" mkc yeah not violent just sad
"
"why all of a sudden man
"
"shes like it was on my mind since vacations started
"
"why did you bring up the moody matter bloody matter
"
"and she cant forgive me for what i did last sem bc vacation mai text nahi karti call nahi karti sahi se. par snapchat jitne logo ke saath streak hai woh sahi se karegi im like bhai aisa long distance mujhe nahi chalega so like start talking basically behen ne toh rokh hi laga diya
"
"usne bola kya? i need a break of one week- two week sort of shit or break for the foreseeable future?
"
"till sem starts
"
"give it to her the break
"
"yeah its not like a mcq where i have options fml
"
"bro this break is a very important for your relationship. whatever happened last semester, whatever you did last semester, she needs to flush that out and this break should make her realise how much you mean to her. i dont know what else to say man. youll just have to wait. tune bahot bada kaand kara tha ab the ball is in her court. tu kuch nahi kar sakta
"
"yep i know that just accepting my fate now
"
"you will either come out of this with a relationship that will be at its strongest or accept and move-on(if the worst happens).
"
"yep know that
"
"exactly
"
"it s fine lets see how this rolls
"
"ek message likh dhang se samjha how much she means to you(dont get too emotional) and clearly state kariyo that you dont mind giving her the time she wants
"
"did that
"
"and then just wait. good man im here for you man. no matter what happens. keep me in the loop
"
"yep i'll try my best to handle it lets see i think she officially broke up she's like i don't feel the same way anymore she still can't get over how i treated pranjal she doesn't like the fact that she has to take my permission for stuff. which she doesnt shes like her not telling me what she's doing every minute of everyday made her feel good she said she doesn't like to share stuff anymore she doesn't want to go the same masters college as me she hates ldr but as they all say, idk what's going to happen man
"
"damn im sorry man. idk man. dont think you can do anything dont think you should do anything right now. wait for manipal when you get to meet her. either youll get closure or you might get back but abhi rehne do kuch bhi if you can. im really sorry man.
"
"thanks i'll do that only fucking girls man dikshita gussa kare ab tu gussa kare life hi sad hai
"
"kesa hai be how you holding up?
"
"sup been going to out a lot and keeping myself distracted agar we even start dating then after manipal long distance ka phirse problem hoga let's see where life takes after this kya hi bolu
"
"true go out. bombay tinder khula saand hai tu ab
"
