"
"is the greedy cycle (1,1,6) cause it's avg latency is less than 3?

"
"i knew you'd forget you told me about how you told your mom about you and dikshita and you also mentioned about how she was molested by some guy in four hundred and fourteen
"
"oh yeah damn
"
"oh and harshit, you and i started talking about how i need to move on from rudhran which is when you said that you understand why i haven't been able to move on from him cause of the way he treated and respected me and then i told you about parv showed you the chat bw him and i that's about it so yeah we did talk quite a lot i guess :')
"
"don't remember any of this ew

"yes
"
"dude is there ca assignment today nvm komal gave me a mini heart attack by telling me there's ca assignment rn jenitttt what you doing
"
"sup
"
"let's make plansss
"
"for
"
"idk drinking plans maybe
"
"tonight?
"
"yeah
"
"we're watching a movie come over if you have nothing to do
"
"okii eyy come down do you have algo lab six codes?
"
"whyd you deactivate your insta
"
"cause i'm unhappy with life. needed a break from social media i'll activate it once i feel good about myself
"
"tell me
"
"eh it's just a bunch of self destructive thoughts which leads to the conclusion that i'm a horrible person
"
"did someone tell you something
"
"nope, not really
"
"vidit already told me tell me when you feel like talking i'm here :)
"
"it's not really related to that i just feel like i'm not important to some people whom i thought cared about me
"
"then telll
"
"thought you should know that mahima and saba are going to confront me about something tonight
"
"do you know why
"
"mahima - maybe because of the misconception that i told vidit that she wanted to hook up w someone that night at big shot. but i only said that cause i was ranting to him about what saba had told me the morning after my drunk night and it was all related in that context. and i think he took it out of proportion and thought she was hooking up w someone and confronted her about it. there's a clear cut difference between wanting to hook up and actually hooking up with someone i have no idea what saba wants to talk about though
"
"so what happened
"
"we sorted stuff out - it's all good now
"
"you deleted this message also you know vidit is not actually bad at you right

"he is. it's just that when you have good company why to ruin it like we don't mind him there it's just that i toh don't want him around

"
"atb https:github.comg31pranjalerplag-compiler https:github.comgaurang18compiler-project-bits-pilani https:github.comkhursheedali38minicompiler try to get one of these working
"
"omg thank you so much!! i'll see what i can do with these
"
"hey how are you doing
"
"i'm alright wbu
"
"i meant after last night shit
"
"they told you? man this is so embarrassing
"
"sasha told harshit. harshit told me in short i'm sorry you were around such shitheads it's me man relax
"
"i dont feel like hanging with them ever again
"
"don't go
"
"they want me to pay for it but why should i pay when the damage was mostly done by them? like, i literally contributed to the mess by 1
"
"they puked on the bed as well right?
"
"yeah jeet walked on the bed with shoes on made the bed very dirty
"
"harshit was really pissed when he came home just tell me properly who all fucked which part of the room we'll try to intervene if we can
"
"only priyank and jeet made the mess dude no one did anything everyone else was sitting and chilling priyank smashed the cake on jeet's face so the cake was literally everywhere on the floor, on the walls, on the curtains then jeet walked all over the bed with those dirty shoes on puked in the washroom and on the bed
"
"sure?
"
"100 nobody else even threw cake on jeet besides priyank i was just sitting on one corner of the bed and it happened there was no need to point it out like that i'm not paying for this shiz
"
"sont exactly this is why he doesn't get girls
"
"he legit has no shame apparently he told sasha that he'll call me up and tell me to pay
"
"balls see it's jeets birthday today so i personally don't want to get into it today. but if harshit wakes up and says so what we need to talk this out, then we'll go up today itself if he calls you and tells you to pay, just blast him off don't get pressurized tell him y'all didn't do shit and the bill would be 36k without your presence as well and he should be ashamed because only he fucked up and hang up pretty much what we're gonna sau
"
"legit but dude, doesnt he have any decency?  i thought i'd just ignore his call
"
"or this tell sasha to tell priyank then that you're not paying
"
"yeahh, sasha mentioned that he'll talk to priyank this entire situation is just awks on top of that, how does he expect us to pay for the damage when jeet and priyank made the mess? he was like ""i dont think its right for one person to pay the entire due"" if the others went crazy and made the mess, then it makes sense
"
"i'm going to talk to raghav about this too dw i'll leave you out of it you relax now just study
"
"okayokay thank u so much
"
"dude did he call you
"
"nope i paid five hundred for the wine and shisha i had at country inn did y'all talk to him or something
"
"we want to know if priyank actually told sasha to call you you deleted this message so when he does and pressurizes you then we'll go
"
"sasha did call me yesterday but he told me to pay for the wine, shisha and the non smoking charges; i told him i'm not paying for the non smoking charges coz its not like i knew they booked a non smoking room
"
"how much for the smoking
"
"not sure, but he asked to pay 1k including the non smoking i gave five hundred instead
"
"i mean all rooms are non smoking but okay 
"
"in that case why smoke in the room if it's a non smoking room country inn has rooms where u can smoke
"
"oh idm idk just pay the five hundred
"
"yupp hanging with them is so annoying
"
"next time get a spine and don't go. your fault for going how many times you wanna get embarrassed man chill with us instead
"
"yeah i know, not gonna go
"
"good
"
"did i tell u they made us pay 1.4k at the surprise party? good thing u didnt go
"
"wtf tomorrow hepta okay
"
"what time??

"i'm so sorry for tonight
"
"its alright you had to choose and it makes sense hope y'all make up tonight ;)
"
"we will  arre it was never about choosing ya don't say like thay
"
"aww nooo that's not what i meant i meant like u would rather have dikshita stay over at ur place than me xd
"
"both would have been best fucking pragati the guard said he's going to call the police
"
"what why???? for what reason????
"
"yeah so i kinda pushed the guard after he nudged me eh it's fine what did mahima even do 
"
"i dunno shes avoiding me is it rly serious? how are things bw u and dikshita ?
"
"you're lucky your lease is till november  it's all sort now in the morning i met the good guard. he's like everything is fine dw. the other is chutiya blah blah. thank god back to normal except her mom knows that i broke her phone 
"
"ahh thank lord. these guards were being such assholes for no reason :( why u gotta pull such stupid stunts xd also, dont tell arav whatever he said to me not sure if he'll remember it but it might be embarrassing for him did u guys finally do the makeup sex  she got mad at me coz she felt like i was ""prioritizing"" you guys over her
"
"probably for the best i guess. man you get hit on so much isn't it like tiring like ""ah, this again"" moment  so you were right about the steamy part only for yesterday?
"
"hahaha quite literally  sadly, i dont know how to get out of that situation. i tried asking u for help but u were too busy making out with dikshita ugh i knew it  gg turns out mothafuckin sasha was lying bout me prioritizing yall over mahina mahima didnt have an issue with that at all sasha told her that i had told a lot of intimate details regarding mahima's sex life to you guys and that had pissed her off; so she confronted me about it and she was gonna end the friendship w me. so i called you to make her believe that i'd never do that to her its sorted now tho sasha was just tryna sabotage my friendship
"
"you should have joined then lol it was the foreplay  i think sasha might have told mahima told harshit awww i got scared when i heard you crying how jobless can someone be man wth
"
"no thx i'm good, dont want to do a threesome with you two  sasha isn't right in the head awww :') the words she used to end the friendship rly hurt man he has some weird vendetta against me and i dont understand why 
"
"shish eh duh
"
"hows it like having the whole house to yourself?
"
"he's so negative aww against everyone. yesterday in the morning he was at my place studying with harshit and talking bs and because of his noise. i told him to stfu beautifully didn't say shit after that loll, arav and harshit are still here harshit had to miss his flight because they preponed it at the last moment
"
"hahahah you're so savage  dude delhi is so fucking hot its like 37 here ded
"
"hahahaha it's not even thirty here but mom said mumbai is too hot man last night here going to be weird going back after so long
"
"it's probably not as bad as manipal tho? ahaha that's how i feel rn i'm still looking for an internship fml where are you interning?

"no man. like after coming back. home has become pretty boring man ya mam i've applied for a few recently no luck tho just praying inget something dude remember the last day at deetee what was dikshita like with me when we were making you feel uncomfortable
"
"she was being her usual self with you she didn't seem angry or anything of that sort to me
"
"horny wise
"
"oh ye, both of you were damn horny y'all kept making out nonstop
"
"so she tells me i don't know if purposely to attack or what that she wasn't in love with me and felt nothing and did what she did only because she was drunk
"
"but how could she just throw away those feelings both of you built over the last two years?
"
"fucking three she's just hurting me purposely by saying rude things all night
"
"dont let that get to you and don't beg her to take you back either or else that might push her away actions speak louder than words; show her that you won't do those things again rather than telling her on text
"
"last night was the pushing away i fucked up last night very bsd manipal is just going to be so bad i can feel it
"
"ahh you have us so dont stress too much but i feel like you need to give her a little time to heal. she might have a change of heart once she sees you face to face
"
"i'm counting on literally that and nothing else seeing that me trying to do anything pisses her off you back yeah?
"
"yesss lmao i just woke up did u go to class?
