how do you know which ones are free variables and how do you set their values
"see the last non zero row u take in echeleon form right, every variable that is left there, can be taken as free variable . cos this gives u free values which scales the whole range"
why did they take it y s t
"if the last equation in echelin for had three variables, u take z n y as free variables as t1 n t2 n write the first variable as combination of these two in the equation n find it's value interns if t1 and t2 ."
okay okay . and what about the random values that they have taken
it is a number which can span the whole space of numbers
yes that's basis . but how did they assume
"u don't have to define , it means it can be any number in the space"
accha . so what should the last step be ? . this should be the last step ticket . right
"like if a variable is a free variable, it necessarily means it belongs to r and all numbers that the given equations derive can be expressed as a linear combination of these free variables . last step is when u transfer the free variables to the first equation . cos the first eqn has highest number of variables in echeleon form no"
yes . and range of t is image of t right
nhi nhi . no relation with that . it basically means it takes all value without restriction
thanks man . they don't give extra time to cripples also shish . our paper was way easier than yours
. damn . compensated . cripple
bro how much did you get in math ? !
16 .5
man he is fucking everyone . and total ?
33 . fckd . i think he's evaluated assignments out of 4 . how much did u gey
26 . just ask him to review it agaon . pm the guy who wrote the text on group
yeah i did . but i think he's corrected it pretty seriously . u r more fckd . at least we got mtech people who score low . i guess cut off will be lower
do you know anyone more than 40 . counting on it man
i guess manav manoj and siddharth got above 40 . i'll ask though . most people lost marks at sessional level only
i got 11 .5 in assignments bro
did u miss any ?
ya man
math oe was a disaster lol
reason i took software testing
"dude, no"
did you take the neural nets one
yeah . soft computing . i like soft computing . but i used to like linear algebra also
i like marks so i'll try to stick to that .
hard realisation . takes time to kick in . i m fckd for one more year lol
will need improve my cgpa after this five month disaster
yeah . honeymoon semester for u . people say it's easier to score in 7th though
bro i'll do eom and shit in the vacations itself . sahil mode on af
sahil class sunta hai . ho payega ? .
atleast 16 classes . and ill do at least one lab without him . should be enough for a 10
there is only one lab . that too web technologoes . chill . that's the amount of optimism i need in life atm
bro do you have notes for single value decomposition . thank bro
. bro . the question paper on the table is mine . could u keep it with urself so ma'am doesn't take it away with her
bro i gave all the papers back
