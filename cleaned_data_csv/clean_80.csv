sun . metacarpals take approx how much time to heal after fracture
is it a hairline or dislocation ? . did you fracture your hands ?
man it got dislocated and i thought ill just push it in . but apparently you should pull and then push it in . so like i dk . ya man . two of  them
oh god you are not supposed to do it yourself
lol
just go to a doctor once . get xray done . either he'll fixate it or tie it up do it doesn't get worse . ya but it is going to take about a month and half to heal completely i feel . how did it happen
fell awkwardly in the bathroom . he sai that he'll take ct scan tomorrow . might need a surgery . ill send the scans tomorrow . will you be able to check if surgery 0is absolutely necessary
oh god . oh god that's way worse shit
i dont have attendance only because of the wedding
i don't really know how to read a ct scan but okay . i could check with a doctor here if you need
show it to teachers . some extracurricular for you
oh ya . ya ya i'll show
good one thanks
"no problem . is this the only image you have ? . also, what did the doctor say ?"
i basically shattered my 5th metacarpal into powder . 4th is also a bit broken . he said that mostly slab should be enough . 5 change that it will pain the future without surgery so i'm not talking it
shit . ya get it operated only na then . although i'll try to show this to some doctor in college tomorrow . don't you have the proper reports but ? like the hard copy of the scan with you . i'll show it here also just like a second opinion
four day admission . thanks
. is it your right hand ?
yes
fuck . take care ya
waiting for scans . will send in a bit . gone your email
okay no problem .
i'll upload the ct scan on going drive . size is too large . i'm sure the teachers will have the required software
"ya got it . ya it's not opening on my phone, so i'll take it on a pendrive and show it tomorrow to the doctor i know . hopefully the file isn't corrupted and it will open"
not corrupted . you need a software to open dicom images . remember this
i downloaded an app and i can view the images there
give good news
sure
i think this has everything
okay . so the doctor i know comes oy on tuesdays and fridays . so should i show it to another doctor or do you want to wait ? . let me know before twelve
just show at least
okay
bt
?
bad trip
quite literally
aisa mat bol yar
"it's just bad luck man . hey . i reviewed his ct . as there is intra articular nature of fracture, which is not reduced on plaster . he will require surgery in the form of most probably k wires ."
fuck
it will be fine re . just get it done it's your right hand . don't risk it . also did you meet your hod ?
he's still on vacation . till monday mostly
nice life he is living
so i'll have to wait
ya wait till then and get it operated . pain is not there na now ?
can't i get a1week healing x ray to see any improvement to get it if the surgery . zero
arey but it is not going to heal with a plaster re
what slab was he saying then
those are really fine bones which won't heal well even if there is plaster for a good amount . your doctor ? . of time
yes in case i don't get the wires . he able said recovery time is saying . also
he also said that there might be issues in the future . it is not a major surgery
arre then they'll keep me for four days . full waste
there is a high chance that your hand functions might get restricted if you don't get it operated upon na . holi ka long weekend is coming
he said this won't happen man . mom will come here then
see this is what this guy told me and the other junior doctor also told me the same thing so i really do think that your doctor after meeting the hod is going to ask you to get operated . what's the problem then
yeah think so too . let's see
ya . just wait till then . sup . did the surgery happen ?
yeah man . 3wires sticking out . your pictures from the wedding are very fuck so . all
best . wtf . thankyou . that is comforting
you . yo . doctor reply asap
what did you break now
no man . so the cook fucked up chicken biryani . i had the chicken . one piece was good . one piece was so bad that it had blood in it . i didn't have a bite from that piece but put it in my mouth
tbh i don't know how to cook that
so of i get salmonella wtf should i do . if
that's a big if . you will probably get bad diarrhoea . plus stomach acid should destroy it so don't worry
good talk . thanks . talk to you in december (hopefully i don't break something)
bye
happy birthday  !
thankyou ! . happy birthday !
thank you ! . doc . hi . so how bad is it if you don't get a skin graft
what did you do to require a skin graft ?
none is fine but the skin was kinda smashed between scooter handle and auto . bone
if the doc told you to get a skin graft and if you don't you it will leave the wound open and could heal slowly . or infection . but i am not sure why you would require skin grafting for this . what did the doc say ?
ill send a pic . getting sutures now loo
okayy . okay that looks deep . but it's a small patch so not sure if it would require a graft ha
bhai
but could definitely leave a scar . what
bc fucking interns . so the chick had a crush on her senior . she's like let me do this this this
i am hopefully going to be one too next year
much karna aata hai nahi
that never ends well
dude she took the suture and kabka
did that intern tell you skin graft laga na padega
shoved it in my bone . and anaesthesia also she gave
also were you like high or something when you were riding the activa ?
no bro . i wasn't even going to hospital . but then i applied ice on the bloody area and blacked out in the restaurant where i was washing hands
oh god why would you not go to the hospital . your right hand is for sure jinxed ha
"and in her second time, she was pulling the wire and it came out from the other end . and last try, puri skin hi nikal di . instead of two they gave only one suture"
okay that image is horrifying . but just keep it clean ha it's thoda deep . mostly toh graft and all itne chote wound k liye nahi chaiye
but like is it compulsory compulsory
no re it's generally for large burns and huge ulcers and stuff where the skin wouldn't grow back easily . plus it's done under general anaesthesia so just for this much it's highly unlikely
best . an intern here was like if it gets infected and spreads then amputation ? ? . i was like dafuq
. that's a very remote possibility but ya do keep it clean . did they give any ointment or antibiotics ?
hamesha right hand ya . antibiotics
jinxed told you na . oh perfect . takes those . take
yep let's hope it's fine my exams start in nine days
how often do i have to get the dressing changed ?
change it 3-4 times a day if it is getting wet a lot . or around two times also works
wait what . no it's not getting wet at all . completely dry . and it's been two days and i haven't gotten it changed . i was given any cream or ointment to apply
okay that's nice . 1-2 times a day works then . keep it dry only
wait so i change it myself ?
yess shouldn't be a problem . send me a picture of the dressing they did ? . ya i think you can do it on your own . unless you want to get it changed and get a follow up done to make aure it is healing well
okay and what do i put directly over the wound
from the hospital
you're doing that
soframycin hai ?
i'll get it
right . okay apply that a little bit and then cotton on top of it and then the patti
that once a day ?
ya after bathing
oh i can wet the area
no no you will have the old dressing na tabhi
i'm just going to keep it dry and change the dressing once a day . cool right ?
yes
get ready for some nasty pictures over the next few days . oh and mom doesn't know about this one . only jheal knows
sure
extracurricular
