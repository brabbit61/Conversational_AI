"
"integration of my model to their webpage and improvement of it
"
"same, i'm trying to integrate it in an app here

"
"everyone i know has already decided
"
"put it anyway word of mouth it shall spread thoda
"
"yessir
"
"you disgust me
"
"i came across this list of deadpool jokes this is just your cover up, i know you silently had a good laugh xd
"
"i can't laugh half my face is swollen
"
"wtf, what happened goddamn why though, was it in an odd position or cavities
"
"both plus more cavities are left fml
"
"dude, shit.... that's very bad
"
"is there any polite way that i can ask my boss for my stipend tomorrow itself. need to get something for mom before leave. ps. boss thinks i'm leaving mumbai on wednesday
"
"when are you actually leaving mumbai? i think you can, tell him the actual reason.... don't try to make up too much stuff, they figure it out most of the times
"
"friday
"
"aaah, so what plans on 21st and 22nd
"
"i'll have to go easy on the weekend because otherwise i'll be risking an infection in my gums sad also do you know the drama that happened with nethraa and all?
"
"no idea man, try asking divya
"
"no dont jesus since when are you trying to ask divya
"
"i haven't, i just asked you to i have no interest in poking into those matters
"
"oh i knoe the drama lol i caused it
"
"then tell xd
"
"in short, dikshita and i have been indirectly chucked out of the nethraa sriya and their group. like nethraa and agrim are against us completely, divya and pranav are very neutral, and all the other girls are inclined to nethraa's side (by inclined i mean they probably dont give a shit about me which is fine but they still might talk to dikshita hopefully) and i also dont give two shits about parth and saurak.
"
"why is all this happening?
"
"nethraa is a cocky (in general), tormenting (towards dikshita) and hypocritical (towards everything) cunt who doesn't accept her mistake, and while i was trying to explain her everything and sort everything out she just couldn't understand jack shit and according to her nothing she did was wrong. and since she is kinda the boss of the group, no one else had the balls to confront her (eventhough most of them agreed about the above mentioned things till an extend). so after the discussion, which was useless, things went south. agrim is her bf so obviously he'll be on her side, so saurak, nethraa and agrim left the whatsapp group and made another one with everyone from the old group except dikshita and i
"
"goddamn why would you want to confront her all of a sudden?
"
"i was hearing thing from months before that were just too shallow, and she was tormenting dikshita like crazy, like dikshita didn't even wanna room up with her for even one more month but dikshita is the complaining kind so she assumed that everything was fine. so dikshita dealt with her part, and i was trying to make her realise what she did (not related to dikshita) was very wrong and that she needed to apologise to the concerned people and also sort the stuff we had between us so that atleast we could still stay friends the point for all this gossip was, no i dont have any plans to go to some hill station or something the coming weekend ) :)
"
"woah, i don't want to comment on anything. but just keep your ground
"
"keep your ground matlab
"
"stick to what you feel is right
"
"that. i will not do that college has taught me to be thoda fake hence fake is what i shall be lol anyways did you play pubg with dikshtia
"
"wokay nope, i think that'll be a lot of fun
"
"man she's addicted

"what's her game name
"
"dikshita98 she has already played over one hundred games 
"
"microsoft internship test scheduled for 24th july. gs internship test will also be in the same week. did you study anything
"
"i'm damn scared now, haven't done jack shit

"i didn't mind it but i didn't like it either
"
"doesn't include all tho
"
"who sent it?
"
"my sister she's a ca so i asked her for help lol
"
"lol why? but we have a scanned doc na for it
"
"arre this specifies what to include in each termn the doc just had the ratios
"
" thankssss dudeee for stock turnover ratio the numerator is cost of goods sold it's not net sales
"
"to use cost of good you also need opening stock which isn't giving so that's why using net sales closing inventory ca has solved all this so just accept and decode. notthing is wrong in this except that you can add preference captial in shareholders equity
"
"that is cool but i mean, we are in a fix na....will the humanities guys accept it? tell me the cost of goods sold in this plis
"
"refer to the formula sheet. it has the break up for all these formula
"
"just this one part
"
"cash purchases?
"
"can we use sales closing inventory here also? no idea what that is
"
"yes it's given in the question
"
"i think it's manufacturing expenses basically purchases but the only problem is, if i do opening stocks in trade  purchases - closing stocks it doesn't satisfy the part that says gross profit  net sales - cost of goods sold
"
"cost of goods is ninety-six thousand  (138000-18000) - one hundred and forty-four thousand
"
"ye cool what about this?
"
"so it might have made a loss?
"
"could be no idea
"
"no but it's written gross profit is 1.5l
"
"and net sale is 1.5l - 6k it is coming -ve that way
"
"no clue
"
"dude rate of gross profit100 is the stock turnover ratio
"
"is it a formula
"
"no no shit (net sales - gross profit)net sales  rate of gross profit
"
"ohh gg
"
"what is average inventories in this case
"
"(96000144000)2
"
"shouldnt we add the cost of building also
"
"idk
"
"kill meeeeee god bless
"
"won't be included as it is a fixed asset
"
"do you instructions associated cost calculations
