Sir, I'm leaving tomorrow for my sibling's wedding and hence will be missing assignment week. When I applied for leave, they didn't consider my request and gave me a leave 24th January onwards.

4/10/19, 1:02 PM - Jenit Jain: In proof by refutation you just prove kb^~a is false
4/10/19, 1:03 PM - Jenit Jain: And in proof by resolution, you just use the resolution formula?
4/10/19, 1:05 PM - Rohit CN: Yes.
4/10/19, 1:05 PM - Rohit CN: But in both the method we use resolution rule only.
4/10/19, 1:05 PM - Rohit CN: We prove resultant to be an empty set.
4/10/19, 1:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes sir, but can't we use modus ponens and the other formulas

This is regarding your assignment 1. You have to submit a new form for assignment mark scale-up requests. Please contact the department for the same.
4/12/19, 12:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Why new sir? I have the old original copy? And the hod has also sanctioned it. Can I submit that to you?
4/12/19, 1:01 PM - Rohit CN: Please ignore this. Because That's what had been communicated recently. However, upon requesting HoD madam, she has agreed for the old one. 

Can you mail me the approval?
