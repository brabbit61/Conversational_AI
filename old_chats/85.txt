3/5/19, 3:27 PM - Vasvi Cs: Is there an option for 'other'?
3/5/19, 3:27 PM - Vasvi Cs: The placement sec said he'll ask and tell
3/5/19, 3:28 PM - Vasvi Cs: But I don't know how long it'll take him
3/5/19, 3:29 PM - Vasvi Cs: Dude I think you can just select the state in which you did your 10th board
3/5/19, 3:29 PM - Vasvi Cs: Regardless of what your board was
3/5/19, 3:32 PM - Vasvi Cs: Okay send an email regarding this query to kishore.b@manipal.edu
3/5/19, 3:33 PM - Vasvi Cs: He said he'll talk to Wipro and get back to you directly

3/5/19, 3:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Like actually, not sarcastic😂
3/5/19, 3:52 PM - Vasvi Cs: Aw you're welcome
3/9/19, 8:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Do you have access to second year time tables for the year?
3/28/19, 5:57 PM - Vasvi Cs: Yo you didn't get an email?
3/28/19, 7:40 PM - Jenit Jain: I thought anyone could give it
3/28/19, 7:40 PM - Jenit Jain: I didn't register or get shortlisted😂
3/28/19, 7:41 PM - Jenit Jain: No idea when you had to fill the application
3/28/19, 7:44 PM - Vasvi Cs: ._.
3/28/19, 7:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh yeah right
3/28/19, 7:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Well then I didn't get any link
3/28/19, 7:46 PM - Jenit Jain: I had submitted with Maharashtra state
4/3/19, 4:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Hey what was the LA portion for 2nd sessionals
4/3/19, 4:21 PM - Vasvi Cs: LA ?
4/3/19, 4:21 PM - Jenit Jain: oe
4/3/19, 4:22 PM - Vasvi Cs: Linear transformation (full)
Inner Product Spaces(until orthogonal basis)
4/3/19, 4:23 PM - Jenit Jain: orthogonal isn't included right
4/3/19, 4:24 PM - Vasvi Cs: It wasn't, but they asked a question that involved knowing the concept of it. So I suggest you go through it
4/3/19, 4:51 PM - Jenit Jain: accha thanks
5/10/19, 7:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Hey, what do we have to with the document you sent on the group regarding getting an internship?
5/10/19, 7:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Like there are only email IDs present so...?
5/10/19, 7:36 PM - Vasvi Cs: The purpose wasn't made clear to us either. You could try visiting their websites and see if it is possible to apply directly for an internship position
5/10/19, 7:37 PM - Vasvi Cs: There are links to their webpages as well right?
5/10/19, 7:46 PM - Jenit Jain: But how is that different than us applying through those websites before? Internshala pure sem kata 😂
5/10/19, 7:51 PM - Vasvi Cs: I think because these specific organizations have signed an MoU with AICTE, getting an internship with them is easier?
5/10/19, 7:51 PM - Vasvi Cs: Internshala is a scam ik xD
5/10/19, 7:51 PM - Vasvi Cs: An* MoU
5/10/19, 7:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Hope so. If you get any clarification, please forward that too. Thanks
5/10/19, 7:56 PM - Vasvi Cs: Sure
6/17/19, 1:43 PM - Jenit Jain: I registered for the TCS test but since I'm travelling to Manipal on that day, I won't be able to sit for the test. Will that be a problem for me? like for my interviews after 20th.
6/17/19, 2:07 PM - Vasvi Cs: I'll find out and get back to you
6/17/19, 2:10 PM - Vasvi Cs: You're asking if you're going to be allowed to sit for other companies? Since you'll be missing the TCS test?
6/17/19, 2:35 PM - Vasvi Cs: <Media omitted>
6/21/19, 6:24 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks a lot
6/28/19, 3:09 PM - Vasvi Cs: Have you registered for HackWithInfy and not received an email?
6/28/19, 3:11 PM - Jenit Jain: I got the email but won't be able to participate
6/28/19, 3:15 PM - Vasvi Cs: Yeah so, there's no requirement to contact the regional recruiter
6/28/19, 3:16 PM - Vasvi Cs: If you're still concerned, you can speak to our placement head
6/28/19, 3:16 PM - Vasvi Cs: Kishore B.vcf (file attached)
6/28/19, 3:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Thank you
