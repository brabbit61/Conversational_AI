The interview process is a tough one so be prepared for that. 
Make sure anything you write on your CV, you have good knowledge about it. If not, remove it right now. 
I would suggest that if you're not great with technical questions, try to prolong the discussion when they ask you about your projects. 
Always start with the least optimized approach while answering a data structure/algorithm question even if you know the best approach. Build your way to the most optimized approach. 
If you have no idea about a question, try to start from the basics, as most of them are quite intuitive. 
Do revise networking and os concepts in between interviews. 
Remain cool, the interviewers are really nice and these aren't like college club interviews where you can bullshit and they won't know it. 
And best of luck!
