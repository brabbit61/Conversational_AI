10/11/18, 7:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Hey, did you solve the question you sent on the group? The same one
10/11/18, 8:01 PM - Kriti Cs: Yup
10/11/18, 8:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Can you please send the solution :)
10/11/18, 8:22 PM - Kriti Cs: This message was deleted
10/11/18, 8:31 PM - Jenit Jain: How'd you get N as 25
10/11/18, 8:33 PM - Kriti Cs: Oh wait
10/11/18, 8:33 PM - Kriti Cs: I was answering some other question
10/11/18, 8:33 PM - Kriti Cs: Ignore that
10/11/18, 8:33 PM - Kriti Cs: So I assumed it's the Illiac 4 network
10/11/18, 8:34 PM - Kriti Cs: It's the simplest design for one PE connected to 4 others
10/11/18, 8:37 PM - Kriti Cs: And we need r which is root N
10/11/18, 8:37 PM - Kriti Cs: And only N= 25 has a proper square root
10/11/18, 8:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Isn't there some formula 2n-1 for the number PEs one PE is connected to
10/11/18, 8:56 PM - Kriti Cs: Um in which topic
10/11/18, 8:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Wait
10/11/18, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: This is in the barrel shifter
10/11/18, 8:59 PM - Kriti Cs: Well iliac routing functions satisfy the condition as well
10/11/18, 9:00 PM - Jenit Jain: The question has only simd so how do we know which network to select?
10/11/18, 9:01 PM - Kriti Cs: Aren't they all SIMD
10/11/18, 9:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Exactly
10/11/18, 9:02 PM - Kriti Cs: Like we only deal with the PEs
10/11/18, 9:02 PM - Kriti Cs: And there are multiple PEs
10/11/18, 9:02 PM - Kriti Cs: So I think both works if they satisfy it
10/11/18, 9:02 PM - Kriti Cs: Like you have to make a barrel shifter network within those constraints
10/11/18, 9:03 PM - Kriti Cs: Mesh network is just easier
10/11/18, 9:03 PM - Kriti Cs: Afaik most did mesh
10/11/18, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Alright
10/11/18, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks
10/11/18, 9:08 PM - Kriti Cs: Welcome 😬
3/25/19, 2:32 AM - Kriti Cs: Hey do we have replacement analysis in the syllabus?
3/25/19, 7:41 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm eefm?
3/25/19, 7:41 AM - Jenit Jain: In*
3/25/19, 7:41 AM - Jenit Jain: Never heard of it🙈
3/25/19, 7:43 AM - Kriti Cs: Nothing nothing I got confused
3/25/19, 7:46 AM - Jenit Jain: All the best🙈
3/25/19, 7:47 AM - Kriti Cs: Thanks 😂
4/25/19, 12:44 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 12:44 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/25/19, 12:55 PM - Kriti Cs: Uh
4/25/19, 12:56 PM - Kriti Cs: What do you mean
4/25/19, 12:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Like how did they get the associated cost
