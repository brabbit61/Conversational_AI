Like you can't find it without actually looking for it. So I was talking on the phone today and she had it in her hand and she was like what is this and she said it smells weird also blah blah. I tried to take it from her to throw it but she said she'll throw it. So she'll mostly show it to dad too tonight

19/12/2019, 16:50 - Jenit Jain: Starting fresh:
19/12/2019, 16:50 - Jenit Jain: So jheal mom did really smoke it.
19/12/2019, 16:51 - Jenit Jain: I swear to God I knew exactly how much was there.
19/12/2019, 16:51 - Jenit Jain: Because when I saw it in the drawer initially

19/12/2019, 16:51 - Jenit Jain: And uska half hai.
19/12/2019, 16:52 - Jenit Jain: And Mom was smelling of it
19/12/2019, 16:52 - Jenit Jain: Can you stop thinking this is a prank or whatever
19/12/2019, 16:52 - Jenit Jain: And act like the older sister you're supposed to be and give a proper reply
19/12/2019, 16:53 - Jenit Jain: And stop with your judging. I'm not having it. I'm old enough. Tu aise treat nahi Kar sakti
19/12/2019, 16:53 - Jenit Jain: And like the grown up I'm, I'm texting my sister about it first before even talking to Mom.
19/12/2019, 16:54 - Jenit Jain: Reply when few
19/12/2019, 16:54 - Jenit Jain: Free
19/12/2019, 16:55 - Jheal: You are stating it as a fact and making this an exciting news
19/12/2019, 16:55 - Jheal: Do you think it is exciting
19/12/2019, 16:55 - Jenit Jain: Okay yeah fine sorry about that
19/12/2019, 16:55 - Jheal: Had you told me this as a concern I wouldn’t have replied the way I did
19/12/2019, 16:56 - Jheal: Better
19/12/2019, 16:56 - Jenit Jain: I've learned not to tell you everything so yeah I'll just be stating facts from now on since you don't like my personality :)
19/12/2019, 16:57 - Jheal: Again there is a way
19/12/2019, 16:57 - Jenit Jain: Do you know mom was/is a stress smoker? I am against cigarettes so yeah that's a proper concern
19/12/2019, 16:57 - Jheal: I just can’t understand you
19/12/2019, 16:57 - Jenit Jain: Explain Karne ki try bhi nahi karunga
19/12/2019, 16:58 - Jenit Jain: But she did pot, and I've never caught that. So I'm sure she does it very rarely and fucking chills out in life prolly whenever she does it.
19/12/2019, 16:58 - Jenit Jain: So yeah I'm kinda happy for her given how stuck she is in the house
19/12/2019, 16:58 - Jenit Jain: ALL THE TIME
19/12/2019, 16:59 - Jheal: How do you know ?
19/12/2019, 16:59 - Jenit Jain: Till date Ive seen ash in her basin thrice when dad wasn't home
19/12/2019, 16:59 - Jenit Jain: One was directly after a fight with dadi
19/12/2019, 17:00 - Jheal: N you’ve not told me that before
19/12/2019, 17:00 - Jenit Jain: I've been trying to make our relationship chiller how its supposed to be at our age over the yearsm and all you've done is judge me for it
19/12/2019, 17:01 - Jenit Jain: I don't need it from you and I don't deserve it
19/12/2019, 17:01 - Jenit Jain: You treat me like that
19/12/2019, 17:01 - Jenit Jain: So don't expect shit out of me.
19/12/2019, 17:01 - Jenit Jain: But anyway
19/12/2019, 17:01 - Jenit Jain: Give your thoughts on the info you just gotm
19/12/2019, 17:03 - Jheal: I can be very ok about stuff ! But you know you’ve not been very easy
19/12/2019, 17:03 - Jheal: I am not judging you ! I am just concerned and hence I try to explain you
19/12/2019, 17:04 - Jenit Jain: You're too uptight because you never had this life during your CA. And it's fine.
19/12/2019, 17:04 - Jenit Jain: Concern ki jab baat ayi hai you know I talk seriously
19/12/2019, 17:04 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita ka sab bataya
19/12/2019, 17:04 - Jenit Jain: Kyo
19/12/2019, 17:04 - Jenit Jain: Not judging you. That's all I've ever received from you man so leave that
19/12/2019, 17:05 - Jenit Jain: I know how to handle our thing hence forth. Mom ki baat chal rahi hai
19/12/2019, 17:05 - Jenit Jain: Woh bags
19/12/2019, 17:05 - Jenit Jain: Bata*
19/12/2019, 17:05 - Jheal: Fine jenit. Do as you please
19/12/2019, 17:06 - Jenit Jain: Mom's thing say
19/12/2019, 17:10 - Jheal: I’ll handle it
19/12/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: No
19/12/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: I'm not being left out of a family thing
19/12/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: This is exactly what I'm talking aboutn
19/12/2019, 17:11 - Jenit Jain: You can't even respect a 21 year old brother enough to include him in such a big thing.
19/12/2019, 17:11 - Jenit Jain: And then you're like oh I'm concerned blah blah
19/12/2019, 17:13 - Jenit Jain: Man dikshita was the most toxic shit I ever met. After the breakup I've actually really imoroved.
19/12/2019, 17:14 - Jenit Jain: This time naresh told mom and Mom told me that jenit accha improve hogaya hai.
19/12/2019, 17:14 - Jenit Jain: So I'm trying to mend the way I've treated everyone at home. You clearly aren't helping me mend shit but excluding me.
19/12/2019, 17:16 - Jheal: Ok sorry
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Jheal: I was just angry the way you texted
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Jheal: I shouldn’t have spoken this way
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Jenit Jain: Blah blah chill hai.
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Jenit Jain: Karna Kya hai par
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Jheal: Do you want to talk to her together ?
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Jenit Jain: Not being rude.
19/12/2019, 17:18 - Jenit Jain: Are you still concerned about the fact or more like want to know what's up ?
19/12/2019, 17:21 - Jheal: Ya of course want to know if she’s ok
19/12/2019, 17:23 - Jenit Jain: So this is a theory. I think she is normal in life. Because this is not near the first time she's smoking up. Nahi toh she wouldn't know how to consume it only. She definitely rolled it and smoked it or maybe dad did it for her. But given the time dad left and when I smelled it I'm sure she did it herself.
19/12/2019, 17:23 - Jenit Jain: But if she's like in a long term depressed state then idk but that's far fetched.
19/12/2019, 17:24 - Jenit Jain: So I THINK she's also using it recreationally
19/12/2019, 17:24 - Jheal: Let’s not assume stuff
19/12/2019, 17:24 - Jheal: And talk to her
19/12/2019, 17:25 - Jenit Jain: Okay so I came up with this plan that over the weekend you come talk to her. You tell her that jenit knew you didn't throw it. And he smelled it and he knows half is missing so don't lie. And then talk supportingly and not like how you talk to me. And save my ass if needed. Sounds good?
19/12/2019, 17:25 - Jenit Jain: Do it over the weekend when I'm not at home.
19/12/2019, 17:26 - Jenit Jain: And tell her that seeing how she did it in the middle of the day, we KNOW it's not her first time.
19/12/2019, 17:27 - Jheal: Ok
19/12/2019, 17:28 - Jenit Jain: Don't throw me under the bus please
19/12/2019, 17:28 - Jenit Jain: Will you talk to jiju about this?
19/12/2019, 17:29 - Jheal: Yes re
19/12/2019, 17:30 - Jheal: Nooo
