3/13/19, 12:34 PM - Jenit Jain: Aisa mat bol yar😂
3/13/19, 12:37 PM - Riti: It's just bad luck man😂
3/13/19, 4:12 PM - Riti: Hey. I reviewed his CT. As there is intraarticular nature of the fracture, which is not reduced on plaster. He will require surgery in the form of most probably K wires.
3/13/19, 4:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Fuck
3/13/19, 4:14 PM - Riti: It will be fine re
3/13/19, 4:14 PM - Riti: Just get it done it's your right hand
3/13/19, 4:14 PM - Riti: Don't risk it
3/13/19, 4:14 PM - Riti: Also did you meet your HOD?
3/13/19, 4:15 PM - Jenit Jain: He's still on vacation
3/13/19, 4:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Till Monday mostly
3/13/19, 4:15 PM - Riti: Nice life he is living
3/13/19, 4:15 PM - Jenit Jain: So I'll have to wait
3/13/19, 4:15 PM - Riti: Ya wait till then and get it operated
3/13/19, 4:15 PM - Riti: Pain is not there na now?
3/13/19, 4:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Can't I get a1week healing x ray to see any improvement to get it if the surgery
3/13/19, 4:16 PM - Jenit Jain: 0
3/13/19, 4:16 PM - Riti: Arey but it is not going to heal with a plaster re
3/13/19, 4:17 PM - Jenit Jain: What slab was he saying then
3/13/19, 4:17 PM - Riti: Those are really fine bones which won't heal well even if there is plaster for a good amount
3/13/19, 4:17 PM - Riti: Your doctor?
3/13/19, 4:17 PM - Riti: Of time^
3/13/19, 4:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes in case I don't get the wires.
3/13/19, 4:18 PM - Jenit Jain: He able said recovery time is saying
3/13/19, 4:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Also*
3/13/19, 4:18 PM - Riti: He also said that there might be issues in the future
3/13/19, 4:19 PM - Riti: It is not a major surgery
3/13/19, 4:19 PM - Jenit Jain: Arre then they'll keep me for 4 days
3/13/19, 4:19 PM - Jenit Jain: Full waste
3/13/19, 4:19 PM - Riti: There is a high chance that your hand functions might get restricted if you don't get it operated upon na

3/13/19, 4:20 PM - Jenit Jain: He said this won't happen man
3/13/19, 4:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Mom will come here then🙄
3/13/19, 4:21 PM - Riti: See this is what this guy told me and the other junior doctor also told me the same thing so I really do think that your doctor after meeting the HOD is going to ask you to get operated
3/13/19, 4:22 PM - Riti: What's the problem then
