7/5/19, 11:48 AM - Maaz Ansari: I completely agree with you and you're not at fault at all
7/5/19, 11:48 AM - Maaz Ansari: But if you want her back

7/5/19, 12:01 PM - Maaz Ansari: And she well
7/5/19, 12:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Dude the thing is she is a very shy person. And for her to tell me the things she told me in the morning is a very big thing. Especially the way she bluntly put it. I want to believe she'll come back but I keep reading what she said and I just can't believe anything
7/5/19, 12:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Like I've never been this scared
7/5/19, 12:03 PM - Maaz Ansari: Fuck

But still her texts are just toooo slow and she's still not taking initiative. And when I meet her like during the breaks and all also she's fine ish. She is really trying to sort it out with that guy but that's not going anywhere.
7/26/19, 8:12 PM - Maaz Ansari: Why do you care now
7/26/19, 8:12 PM - Maaz Ansari: Just be there as a friend or not even that

7/26/19, 8:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Worse, she's becoming tighter with her ex so that's fucking annoying.
7/26/19, 8:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Then she made a rule of chilling just once a week. And I obviously tried to violate it and she's like I don't want to take advantage of your niceness ????
7/26/19, 8:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Bhai Matlab that hookup thing was just validation type
