[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: His point is that in his friend groups are all cool and studs and they find sex and all cool and shit
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: He can't afford to say that he is a virgin
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: I'm toooo disgusted
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Chi that's damn sycophant type
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: Ikr
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: And i don't lie about it so I say if anyone asks me that no and all
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: So he isn't okay w it because it's affecting his reputation
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: I don't know how to react
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: I can't believe he thinks this way
[22/01, 2:30 AM] Pranu USA: Jenit has asked you to explain "complex and real" to give me perspective hehe😂
[22/01, 7:56 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Okkk
[22/01, 7:57 AM] Dikshita Kothari: He forgot you're a commerce student
[22/01, 7:57 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Okayy
[22/01, 7:57 AM] Dikshita Kothari: No problem
[22/01, 8:06 AM] Dikshita Kothari: So current in any resistor is divided into two parts complex and real as in a+ib 
The real part of current = a 
The complex part of current = b 
Only the real part adds to the power of the resistor while the complex part reduces it. Real part is constant while complex is variable. 
Imagine you're the resistor. 
Each person in your life can and should be divided into two sections. Complex and real. 
Anyone who contributes to your life in any way and adds to you as an individual is a real person. Anyone who adds to your problems is complex. You should keep the real people carefully and not pay attention to the complex components. Or the real people are your "friends" and the complex people are your "colleagues". 
Not only people this applies to everything in your life. Anything fixed is real and anything variable is complex. 
Each night before you sleep you have to make a list. Three things that are real and three complex things. 
For example You can think of pizza as real and a pimple as complex. 
Pin the real components in your life and know how they contribute to you. The complex components are just holding you back as an individual, they're temporary and should be removed.
[22/01, 10:58 AM] Pranu USA: I'm shook
[22/01, 10:59 AM] Pranu USA: What an amazing perspective
[22/01, 10:59 AM] Pranu USA: Killed it

[22/01, 11:03 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Yas
[22/01, 11:03 AM] Dikshita Kothari: I was very drunk when I thought of this
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: It's tooo lit
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: You won't believe
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: Anuvrat is saying that to those people who he has already said he has had sex and if he can't take my name, he will take someone else's
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: You have no idea what's going through me right now
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Pranu USA: I feel like slapping him so hard that he can never speak again
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Dikshita Kothari: You should
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Pranu USA: He can break a relationship but not say " I was just messing/joking around but really haven't ""
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Pranu USA: He has to take a name
[22/01, 11:06 AM] Pranu USA: Even if one lets this go, the mentality only is completely wrong

1/22/19, 8:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I was miserable
1/22/19, 8:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You cannot oppress your opinion on me
1/22/19, 8:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I won't have it
1/22/19, 8:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That is it

1/22/19, 8:34 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're okay with being friends with me
1/22/19, 8:34 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Her *
1/22/19, 8:34 PM - Jenit Jain: IDK how to respond to thus
1/22/19, 8:34 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But you have a problem with me being friends with people who are none of these things
1/22/19, 8:35 PM - Jenit Jain: She's not like that with me. And I know how to pull her strings to bring her in her aukad
1/22/19, 8:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You shouldn't have to do that
1/22/19, 8:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And by that I know you mean insulting
1/22/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Your friends are so inexperienced with social things that it makes me uncomfortable when they are around you
1/22/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: No
1/22/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't insult
1/22/19, 8:36 PM - Jenit Jain: I just bring up things from the past that show her true character and then she's like ya na man sorry na whatever

1/22/19, 8:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm from a girl's schooollll

1/22/19, 8:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay good then
1/22/19, 8:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Dude it's been 2.5 years. You've changed. They are still like Bhai ladki se kaise baat karte hai
1/22/19, 8:39 PM - Jenit Jain: And not because they are introvert
1/22/19, 8:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Just remember that every second you're with them I'm feeling uncomfortable.
1/22/19, 8:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Now go I won't meddle with your college
1/22/19, 8:41 PM - Jenit Jain: And you probably don't want me around your friends because all Im gonna do is just show them their true character.
1/22/19, 8:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Except like your showstopper ones
1/22/19, 8:41 PM - Jenit Jain: They are chill
1/22/19, 8:48 PM - Dikshita Kothari: The day you stop doing weed I'll stop hanging with my class people
1/22/19, 8:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Wow okay

1/22/19, 8:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're addicted to it
1/22/19, 8:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe you should think about that
1/22/19, 8:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Instead of wasting time with my class friends
1/22/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: The conclusion is based in a false pretense as it is not supported by arguments
Weed is non addictive
My stamina is very high now
I don't feel withdrawal every
Until further information is provided, we have no reason to believe the conclusion
1/22/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: 6/6
1/22/19, 9:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Tbh i know I'm obsessed with hating your friends it truly is a bad waste of time. Moreover it's not even like I'm possessive which I'm glad about. But my only reason for it is me being concerned about your safety
1/22/19, 9:08 PM - Jenit Jain: It's annoying that you bring up pot only when you want an argument is going on.
1/22/19, 9:08 PM - Jenit Jain: Last sem after you said I decreased also

1/22/19, 9:11 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Should not be so difficult
1/22/19, 9:12 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll try my best Is all I can tell you because of the reason that it is usually there at gomen
1/22/19, 9:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why try you're toh not addicted na

1/22/19, 9:14 PM - Jenit Jain: Theyll just sit in my room and smoke while I do work and then when it's my turn keep the bong in front of me and then pester me.
1/22/19, 9:14 PM - Jenit Jain: I've done everything you've said
1/22/19, 9:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Just say no

1/27/19, 12:43 AM - Jenit Jain: Just because sriya understood the gravity of the situation after I texted her doesn't mean something in uour head clicked
1/27/19, 12:43 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Pakka
1/27/19, 12:44 AM - Jenit Jain: So does that mean youll still greet them ?

1/27/19, 12:46 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Complex
1/27/19, 12:46 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Af
1/27/19, 12:47 AM - Jenit Jain: My girlfriend getting insulted and then acting stupid enough to go back is the biggest concern for me.
1/27/19, 12:47 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre I don't care baba
1/27/19, 12:47 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Really
1/27/19, 12:47 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Let them think what they want
1/27/19, 12:47 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I really just wanted to play stock exchange I swear
1/27/19, 12:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You know na
1/27/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: You are to completely ignore their existence hence forth. Please text me when you "really" understand why I want you to do that. When it comes to nethraa, since she's a girl, I'll leave it up to you.
1/27/19, 12:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I really didn't care
1/27/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: My best friends were across the hall
1/27/19, 12:49 AM - Jenit Jain: Seeing as they are your friends and the 414 aren't even friends of yours I know what I would have selected if I was in your shoes.
1/27/19, 12:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I really understand I swear
1/27/19, 12:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No no I knocked to say hi

1/27/19, 12:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No one was there
1/27/19, 12:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: They would've gone somewhere
1/27/19, 12:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I just find it easier to forget what happened and talk to 414
1/27/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I rang the bell
1/27/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I swear
1/27/19, 12:50 AM - Jenit Jain: You just keep proving me right about your stupidity
1/27/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I won't lie to you
1/27/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not stupid
1/27/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: My aim today was to have fun

1/27/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause I got what I wabted
1/27/19, 12:51 AM - Jenit Jain: When you understand this text me in fb, I'll unblock you. Because rn, I really don't wanna talk to dikshita that does such reckless and self demeaning things. My actual dikshita is much smarter than that.

1/27/19, 7:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Good should be
1/27/19, 7:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Hey Dikshita, I'm not completely woke about all the things that have been happening but I thought that parth, you and I were always as we were last night. I thought it was just the lack of opportunities to meet up, that we didn't hang out as much. I apologise if it felt like we didn't support you in the whole anirudh business. But we did, when we met him we talked about it, I mean I felt that he has to at least apologise and try to make up. I admit that I don't have answers for a lot of things.
More importantly, I am sorry if this offends you, but I just need to know. 
Jenit texted parth and told him and me to "stay away" from his "girlfriend" , normally I would ignore it. But you have spoken through him in the past and I just want to confirm if he is speaking for you this time too.
1/27/19, 7:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell him it's all me
1/27/19, 7:35 PM - Jenit Jain: And comment about sriyas screenshots. That if 20 isn't old enough to know what's molestation and what's not then you legally belong behind the bars.
1/27/19, 7:35 PM - Jenit Jain: This is your only turn to keep your firm standn
1/27/19, 7:35 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't fuck it up by being diplomatic
1/27/19, 7:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Aiyo

1/27/19, 7:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want to get involved

1/27/19, 9:28 PM - Jenit Jain: If you didn't wanna be then you would have kept your phone side mao
1/27/19, 9:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: He texted me I didn't know what to do
1/27/19, 9:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I thought I should say something to diffuse the situation
1/27/19, 9:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't know okay
1/27/19, 9:29 PM - Jenit Jain: You're diffusing my joy and vaporizing my image.

1/27/19, 9:30 PM - Jenit Jain: It's just that you're too stubborn and stupid to see it.
1/27/19, 9:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't carry grudges throughout my life

1/27/19, 9:31 PM - Jenit Jain: When it comes to guys I will handle it.
1/27/19, 9:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Aapne kiya mujhe pata hai
1/27/19, 9:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks for paying me back in such a way
1/27/19, 9:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't treat people differently if they're girls or guys na
1/27/19, 9:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: This is not about you Jen
1/27/19, 9:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Girls I can't say anything because they are your only block friends.
1/27/19, 9:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Honestly I will be very fake to Divya also from now

1/27/19, 9:35 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't say that I got over it then
1/27/19, 9:35 PM - Jenit Jain: You're being self-contradictory
1/27/19, 9:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No no

1/27/19, 9:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
1/27/19, 9:37 PM - Jenit Jain: But I'm going to be very fake with her.
1/27/19, 9:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you don't include everyone
1/27/19, 9:37 PM - Jenit Jain: And we'll still go on triple dates
1/27/19, 9:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't be
1/27/19, 9:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No need

1/27/19, 9:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: People make mistakes
1/27/19, 9:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No one is perfect babu
1/27/19, 9:38 PM - Jenit Jain: I know. The way you embarrassed me today was surely a mistake
1/27/19, 9:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: They all made the same mistake
1/27/19, 9:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Let's hope you learn
1/27/19, 9:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You should not have involved everyone. I told you this yesterday itself. I told you that you were embarrassing me. That you were hurting me but nothing

1/27/19, 9:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No you can't do that
1/27/19, 9:40 PM - Jenit Jain: You were the victim
1/27/19, 9:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You can't make me feel the stuff I don't or vice versa

1/27/19, 9:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: As in you can't make me not feel embarrassed when I do
1/27/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha.
1/27/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: But Divya se I'm talking now
1/27/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: On gossip only
1/27/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
1/27/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: You better hold your texting.
1/27/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't kick me out
1/27/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
1/27/19, 9:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You should talk to Pranu about this
1/27/19, 9:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Not these guys
1/27/19, 9:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She doesn't know anything
1/27/19, 9:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So you will have to tell her from the start
1/27/19, 9:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Leave Divya Jen
1/27/19, 9:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She doesn't have an opinion
1/27/19, 9:44 PM - Jenit Jain: What will we hey out of that
1/27/19, 9:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Let her say it out explicitly.
1/27/19, 9:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You will get satisfaction
1/27/19, 9:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why
1/27/19, 9:45 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't know anything about divyas opinion
1/27/19, 9:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you na
1/27/19, 9:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She doesn't
1/27/19, 9:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I just spoke to jenit. 

Most of everything that happened was my fault so, I'm sorry. I didn't know I was ignoring so many things especially, your prespective. And I'm sorry for that too. There isn't really anything that I can do to fix anything, I just felt like apologizing, so that's what I'm doing. I guess we won't be meeting much after this, yesterday was a lot of fun and thanks for the Brownies. Will miss playing board games.
1/27/19, 9:46 PM - Jenit Jain: That she'll say that yes dikshita shouldnt have gone to 414?
1/27/19, 9:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She will say what useless friends
1/27/19, 9:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Then both of you can establish that all my friends are horrible
1/27/19, 9:48 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Who are you talking to
1/27/19, 9:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Sahil
1/27/19, 9:48 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Huh
1/27/19, 9:48 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why
1/27/19, 9:50 PM - Jenit Jain: That will give me satisfaction but my point her is to get your justice and to (forcefully till the point that you wanna break up with me) keep you away from the people who have wronged you. You are a stupid child who goes to wrong things, it is literally job as a boyfriend (father away from home) to keep you guarded.
1/27/19, 9:50 PM - Jenit Jain: Theres not a single soul who can stop me from doing that hence I shall cross all boundaries to make sure you are safe and guarded.
1/27/19, 9:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'll be safe but damn lonely Jen
1/27/19, 9:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Much better than to hang out with snakes.
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Last semester you only told me to go talk go talk
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Jenit Jain: You chill with your class ones without booze and the girls I won't say anything because then you'll be in a safe zone.
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: This semester
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Jenit Jain: To whom
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're like don't hang out
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Girls
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Nooooo
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Never
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Jenit Jain: I meant I won't be trusting any of them except sriya
1/27/19, 9:52 PM - Jenit Jain: You're free to do what you want with the girls.
1/27/19, 9:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Divya, I want her to say that she didn't do shit
1/27/19, 9:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Then I'll remove the fake me
1/27/19, 9:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
1/27/19, 9:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If I say don't do it will you listen
1/27/19, 9:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Confront her?
1/27/19, 9:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You shouldn't break friendships like this Jen
1/27/19, 9:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I've worked very hard to build them
1/27/19, 9:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Tu nanga hi toh aaya hai Kya ghanta leke jayega
1/27/19, 9:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What
1/27/19, 9:54 PM - Jenit Jain: How is it affecting your friendship with her
1/27/19, 9:54 PM - Jenit Jain: I won't even shout
1/27/19, 9:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm going to go talk to Pranu
1/27/19, 9:55 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll just be like thanks for the honesty
1/27/19, 9:55 PM - Jenit Jain: About whag
1/27/19, 9:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: About how you've gone mad

1/27/19, 9:58 PM - Jenit Jain: You should give my friends a shot. 
Gfs very easily join groups, they already think you're an angel, most of all they might decrease smoking up because of you.
1/27/19, 9:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: All bad
1/27/19, 9:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Or I just get over what they did

1/27/19, 10:00 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Same with these guys
1/27/19, 10:00 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe there is something worth waiting for
1/27/19, 10:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Second semester was hookup please. But thanks.
1/27/19, 10:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Han but you were my friend only na
1/27/19, 10:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Fair point
1/27/19, 10:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And you were hurting me na
1/27/19, 10:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But I knew
1/27/19, 10:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That it's fine
1/27/19, 10:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause in the end
1/27/19, 10:02 PM - Jenit Jain: But for me they are done. Hence I'm telling you to do what you wish with the girls but I need to clear it out.
1/27/19, 10:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Something nice will happen
1/27/19, 10:02 PM - Jenit Jain: I love you
1/27/19, 10:02 PM - Jenit Jain: .
1/27/19, 10:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why won't you listen to me

1/27/19, 10:11 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause you didn't ask my opinion
1/27/19, 10:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's the same as everyone else's
1/27/19, 10:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't even attempt to understand my side
1/27/19, 10:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Every

1/27/19, 10:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Upach you shouldn't be
1/27/19, 10:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She says first whenever she feels bad about something someone said
1/27/19, 10:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Even with Agrim she said
1/27/19, 10:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And even with Nethraa she said
1/27/19, 10:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine then only s and p
1/27/19, 10:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Upasana was there in Manipal when the entire Anirudh thing happened
1/27/19, 10:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I spoke to her and all
1/27/19, 10:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya
1/27/19, 10:36 PM - Jenit Jain: What did she sau
1/27/19, 10:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She's like what an ass
1/27/19, 10:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But she didn't know what to do after that
1/27/19, 10:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No one did
1/27/19, 10:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Shes a kid. Fair enough
1/27/19, 10:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: For me it's not fair enough ?
1/27/19, 10:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Not no one.
1/27/19, 10:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Who am I dating
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Also dikshita I need to make you understand
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: We are 1 team
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: 1
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: We affect each other
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I will make you understand
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm the team leader
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You have to listen to me
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If we don't have same views then you have to listen to me
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Not in such cases. You don't know half of anything.
1/27/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Lol no
1/27/19, 10:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Then we have to come to a conclusion then you can involve other people
1/27/19, 10:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: First at least you should make sure we're on the same ground
1/27/19, 10:40 PM - Jenit Jain: And I need you to stop going behind my back and doing things and then telling me oops I did this. I will not tolerate that even one more time. Recently only you did it tons of times. I need to able to blindly trust my gf. Otherwise relationship isn't worth it. So on this front, I'm completely saturated, I don't know what will happen next time you go behind my back.
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: You are always on the wrong one
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So you have to talk to me
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe the wrong one is the right one
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: We will talk about this over pizza
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Stfu
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: On Friday
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: What
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Anyways period rahega
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No you haven't listened at all
1/27/19, 10:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Did it start
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: This entire argument you only screamed at me
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Have
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And didn't listen to what I wanted to say
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Bexause you went behind my back.
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Oops
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Chup
1/27/19, 10:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't listen to me when I told you to shut up
1/27/19, 10:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If you don't listen I will also not listen
1/27/19, 10:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I will fight petty with petty
1/27/19, 10:43 PM - Jenit Jain: Whatever the case might be, I will not tolerate you going behind my back ever again. I will not have my trust broken again. On that front, our relationship is not the strongest currently so be careful.
1/27/19, 10:44 PM - Jenit Jain: When man.
1/27/19, 10:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Yesterday with girls?
1/27/19, 10:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
1/27/19, 10:45 PM - Jenit Jain: I've realized that we fight about the same things is because when we initially fight, I always cave in and the issue remains unsolved. And since we fight about very very limited things, thank God, might as well clear it for good
1/27/19, 10:45 PM - Jenit Jain: And that's what I did
1/27/19, 10:46 PM - Jenit Jain: See again I'm putting you/ our relationship first. I need you to give me equal support
1/27/19, 10:46 PM - Jenit Jain: By being honest

1/27/19, 10:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Delayed Truth is only so much better than lying dikshita.
1/27/19, 10:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Post
1/27/19, 10:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Post
1/27/19, 10:50 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm tired of the delayed Truth and you acting like a solo player.
1/27/19, 10:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Can't deal with these 2
1/27/19, 10:51 PM - Jenit Jain: At all
1/27/19, 10:51 PM - Jenit Jain: 0 tolerance
1/27/19, 10:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre then I won't get to play games
1/27/19, 10:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Solo cause you didn't talk to me before talking to everyone else and so obviously conflict of opinion hoga
1/27/19, 10:53 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll play or girls or class people if they don't cut into my time
1/27/19, 10:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay I don't mind
1/27/19, 10:53 PM - Jenit Jain: RN saurak thing also
1/27/19, 10:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya
1/27/19, 10:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You knew I didn't feel the same way
1/27/19, 10:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you to talk
1/27/19, 10:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If he texts me I will say what I think is right na
1/27/19, 10:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: How is it my fault
1/27/19, 10:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Toh tell me you're texting him so that I can tell the right things or that you can tell the right things. You embarrassed me then
1/27/19, 10:55 PM - Jenit Jain: You told be to text them why would you
1/27/19, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Team player bano nahi toh baki sab ki tarah single raho
1/27/19, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: I know what I want
1/27/19, 10:56 PM - Jenit Jain: You decide what you want
1/27/19, 10:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Whether you like it or not, your life is intertwined with mine, your decisions directly affect me. Abhi insult karna hai toh karlo. But I don't want to be in such a relationship
1/27/19, 10:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause you didn't listen when I said don't and then I gave up
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Not them, I meant only saurak today
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're not understanding me only
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm not
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Even I said for Saurak also
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't give you number in the morning
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But no
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You want to text everyone
1/27/19, 10:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And make the entire thing so public
1/27/19, 11:00 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Even I was embarrassed
1/27/19, 11:00 PM - Jenit Jain: It would have been less if at least we looked like a team. You spoiled that too but
1/27/19, 11:00 PM - Dikshita Kothari: SINCE WHEN THE FUCK HAVE YOU STARTED TO THREATEN ME SAYING THAT YOU DONT WANT TO BE IN THE RELATIONSHIP
1/27/19, 11:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I was embarrassed before you
1/27/19, 11:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You disregarded my feelings completely throughout the entire thing
1/27/19, 11:02 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't threaten in such things. If I wanted to break up I would have. And the reason I'm bringing breaking up for the first time ever in 3 years is because I never thought you could break my trust so often.
1/27/19, 11:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Especially when I'm away
1/27/19, 11:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Break your trust about what
1/27/19, 11:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: TOLD YOU WHAT I WAS DOING
1/27/19, 11:03 PM - Jenit Jain: You're right
1/27/19, 11:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Delayed Truth and contradicting me with saurak.
1/27/19, 11:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That is not break of trust
1/27/19, 11:04 PM - Jenit Jain: And I'm sorry for that but I just had to clear everything out because as j said, unsolved issues lead to our recurrent fights.
1/27/19, 11:04 PM - Jenit Jain: It is.
1/27/19, 11:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No it's not
1/27/19, 11:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I went to play stock exchange
1/27/19, 11:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't go to become chaddi buddies
1/27/19, 11:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Embarrassing me in front of others by contradicting me and delayed Truth especially about the things I'm sensitive about
1/27/19, 11:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Contradict nahi kiya Maine
1/27/19, 11:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: My view is different from yours
1/27/19, 11:05 PM - Jenit Jain: I said to stay away and you said I want it to be normal.
1/27/19, 11:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You embarrassed me first arre ?
1/27/19, 11:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Toh you fucking tell me so I can phrase my messages right.
1/27/19, 11:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks for the petty revenge then I guess
1/27/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I TOLD YOU, YOU DIDNT LISTEN YOU LEGIT SAID YOUR VIEW IS SHIT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY BHAAV TO IT SO THEN DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES JENIT.
1/27/19, 11:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No how is your embarassment greater than mine
1/27/19, 11:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't behave as if I did anything wrong
1/27/19, 11:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I know I didn't
1/27/19, 11:07 PM - Jenit Jain: I did it frontnof your friends, you didn't it in front of my for.
1/27/19, 11:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Foe*
1/27/19, 11:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Great
1/27/19, 11:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: ALL I'M DOING IS FIGHTING FOR YOU EVEN THOUGH I DON'T COMPLETELY AGREE
1/27/19, 11:08 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks for not acknowledgjng us as a team.
1/27/19, 11:08 PM - Jenit Jain: You would be helping me if you did this. Yet you didn't.
1/27/19, 11:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're not acknowledging us as a team
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Go outside and talk
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You think it's better to talk to other people to get their view first before clearing everything with me
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Charge
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No jenit so many mistakes you've made
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: We we're fighting about your friends also so why not clear with them
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't acknowledge my feelings
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: You don't even see yours
1/27/19, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: I acknowledge this mistake
1/27/19, 11:10 PM - Jenit Jain: You're not even ready to acknowledge yours

[27/01, 10:55 PM] Jen: You decide what you want
[27/01, 10:57 PM] Jen: Whether you like it or not, your life is intertwined with mine, your decisions directly affect me. Abhi insult karna hai toh karlo. But I don't want to be in such a relationship

1/27/19, 11:17 PM - Jenit Jain: And fuck up everything else

1/27/19, 11:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And the only option I had left
1/27/19, 11:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Was to play

1/29/19, 6:42 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Everyone says this only
1/29/19, 6:42 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Ask them how they define leagues next time
1/29/19, 6:42 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sure their answer will be wrong and stupid
1/29/19, 6:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: There is a phrase that I'm working on eliminating from my vocabulary, and it's one that we all use too frequently. When analyzing the potential compatibility between ourselves and a suitor, oftentimes, the "he's out of my league" excuse comes into play. He (or she) is too tall, too attractive, too smart, too funny, too ambitious or just too plain awesome to be interested in you, right? Wrong. I've come to the realization that no one is truly "out of my league," and here's why.

Let's get this straight: this is no self-serving, pretentious piece proclaiming my alluring charm and dashing good looks. Nope, not at all. I still struggle with my body image issues and self-esteem just like many others do. But I've realized how an iterating simple phrase can become a concept that we really buy into and believe -- we contribute to damaging our self-perception.

The problem is, when we say that someone is "out of our league," we begin believing it. I used to say that guys were out of my league all the time.

"He's too handsome and I'm so average."


"He's hilarious and outgoing; my awkward and goofy sense of humour is no match."

I put myself down despite the other redeeming qualities I have. I viewed my worth as based on how attractive other people thought I was. You can say you don't do this, but you probably do. When we're rejected by someone, we never say, "It must be because I have a really awesome future ahead of me and I'm a really motivated person." No. It's always something along the lines of, "I guess I am not hot enough/fit enough/fun enough/smart enough" for this person's attention.

Even when the situation doesn't apply to ourselves, we apply the method of thinking that people are grouped into leagues. I, too, am guilty of sitting with friends (or hey, even people-watching by myself) and seeing a couple go by with one very attractive partner and one average or "below-average" partner while thinking, "Wow, how did they end up together?"

As someone who genuinely strives to be pro-heathy body image and socially conscious, I realize that I'm contributing to a huge problem in a way that I never realized. I am equating myself and others to a subjective sense of beauty and worth that can't be standardized or wholly assessed by anybody. No one can determine who is in a certain league, because leagues don't exist.
1/29/19, 6:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: When someone says that you can say this
1/29/19, 6:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Simply harassing my boy

1/30/19, 2:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Kinda makes sense no offence
1/30/19, 2:22 PM - Jenit Jain: But in today's zamana the relationship between in laws and bahu is informal so eh
1/30/19, 2:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Pehle it was just for the sake of it
1/30/19, 2:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Eh

2/10/19, 12:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Simply I don't want to walk extra
2/10/19, 12:14 PM - Jenit Jain: Oksyyy
2/10/19, 8:45 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
2/10/19, 9:36 PM - Jenit Jain: You not even understanding your mistake shows how much you learned from our previous fights about the same reason. So next time you don't ask me why I keep fighting for the same reason.
2/10/19, 9:36 PM - Jenit Jain: It's your fault only. No one elses
2/10/19, 9:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks for embarrassing and not even owning upto it
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Stop saying the same thing 5000 times
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I was drunk
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't know
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Stop doing the same thing 5000 times
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Bas you just need an excuse to fight
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Stop trying to dominate me
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like it
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm not gonna fight anyway. It just wastes my time. You're not going to do your end so fuck it
2/10/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Cool
2/10/19, 9:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I am listening to you and you know it
2/10/19, 9:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Change doesn't happen overnight
2/10/19, 9:43 PM - Jenit Jain: cool
2/10/19, 9:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Simply scolding me for the same thing isn't going to help
2/10/19, 9:47 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What's more I gave you legit 0 shit for the somiya thing. Because I knew it would've been hard for you. That wasn't insulating for me or what. I got over it. I gave you time to get over it too. Instead of helping me and instead of asking me how I feel about it all you're doing it adding to the pressure and acting like a fucking dominating asshole. I told you you didn't consider my feelings last time. Did you improve on that ? No
2/10/19, 9:48 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not the only one making the same mistake again and again Jen. You can't even see what mistake you made. What are you trying to do ? Make me scared of you ? Cause it's working. I now think I have to run everything past you cause you never know what will piss you off. So annoying. Let me be.
2/10/19, 9:53 PM - Jenit Jain: I didn't think of it this way but dikshita they were fucking assholes to you. You shouldn't be talking to them and I shouldn't be reminding you that you need not talk to them. You should be big enough to understand such a thing. Minor fuck ups are fine. What they did was major. You should be mature enough to know that
2/10/19, 9:53 PM - Jenit Jain: But you don't do anything about it
2/10/19, 9:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Which hurts me more
2/10/19, 9:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I WAS DRUNK
2/10/19, 9:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I spoke to a stranger
2/10/19, 9:54 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm not trying to make you scared of me. I'm just trying to make you listen.
2/10/19, 9:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No Jen you are making me scared of you
2/10/19, 9:55 PM - Jenit Jain: You need not be
2/10/19, 9:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If you control me so much I'll stop telling you alltogether.  Please stop it. Don't try to dictate your terms on me. I don't think like you do and I never can. I don't want any trouble. Least of all from you. I tell you everything Jen just thoda let me be relaxed. Everytime I do something I don't want to think about oh god jenit kya bolega oh shit I can't fight over this again. Leave it I'll not tell him. The day this happens it'll be very bad baby please try to understand. The tighter you try to hold a lump of sand in your hand the faster it'll fall through. Don't try to assert yourself. What you say is important and I'll listen to you. But you have to give me some time. It's not easy for me.
2/10/19, 9:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What do I do man I'll throw a bomb in their house kya.
2/10/19, 9:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Jen I can't go around telling people they fucked up that's not my job
2/10/19, 10:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And honestly I don't care. You don't want to talk to them, don't talk. I also won't but I don't want to feel uncomfortable everytime they're around. I've been through it with Nethraa. I hate that situation. You saw na what the girls said. It's not worth it.
2/10/19, 10:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What's more they're complex components and they will always be so I won't really care about it.
2/10/19, 10:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: IN CAPITAL I WILL WRITE AGAIN- I WAS VERY DRUNK I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
2/10/19, 10:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: IF I WAS SOBER I WOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM AS I DID NOT WHEN I MET THEM IN MCDONALD'S THE OTHER DAY
2/10/19, 10:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine
2/10/19, 10:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay I'll listen to you
2/10/19, 10:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: WHAT YOU SAY IS NOT LOST ON ME BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR ME TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT CAUSE I HAVE NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE THIS. SO JUST AND ONLY FOR YOU I AM CHANGING THIS 'RULE' THAT I HAVE.
2/10/19, 10:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's already very difficult
2/10/19, 10:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't give more BT about this please

2/15/19, 7:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Compounding period and payment period is same
2/15/19, 7:55 AM - Jenit Jain: If question is compounded binannually at 8%
2/15/19, 7:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Ok

2/15/19, 7:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Nominal is 4%
2/15/19, 7:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Effective is m= 2 n= 2
2/15/19, 7:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If they said 18% compounded monthly 
Nominal is 1.5 % cause 18/12
2/15/19, 7:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Over here 4% cause 8/2

3/3/19, 6:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Pranjal EEE A.vcf (file attached)
3/3/19, 6:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Go talk
3/3/19, 6:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Alone
3/3/19, 6:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Not with group
3/3/19, 6:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Hello Pranjal 
This is about the message you sent me last night and everything before that. 
Thank you for being such a great friend and for always being so helpful. 
However, I feel that this is going too far and I should stop it before it gets worse. Please try and understand that I have a boyfriend who I love very much and I do not see you as more than a friend. Don't take this in the wrong way but I think you need to take a step back. This is for the better of both of us and ultimately even you will be less hurt in the future. I am sorry but nothing is going to happen between us ever. The faster you make peace with that the better it will be for you and me. I would still like to be your friend but I cannot be anything more.
3/3/19, 8:11 PM - Jenit Jain: Are you sure you didn't text parth
3/3/19, 8:13 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
3/3/19, 8:17 PM - Jenit Jain: What did pranjal say
3/3/19, 9:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Kaustubh and I met him. He came with his class people. I told him to come aside and he wasn't. So I started talking and then he obviously couldn't say. Then I got too violent so kaustubh took over. He couldn't say anything he was too shut. So we told his classmates to handle him. They said yeah bro. And his friends judged him when I showed them the 21list
3/3/19, 9:16 PM - Jenit Jain: You will never acknowledge his existence.
3/3/19, 9:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Jayant and rishab were on our side
3/3/19, 9:17 PM - Jenit Jain: They judged him
3/3/19, 9:17 PM - Jenit Jain: No physical
3/3/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: And. Not apologizing for my behaviour today
3/3/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Goodnight.
3/3/19, 9:25 PM - Jenit Jain: PS you won't be losing any friends.
3/3/19, 9:31 PM - Jenit Jain: PS I was VERY cordial with rishab and jayant. They are very nice and they were very understanding
3/3/19, 9:34 PM - Jenit Jain: And we gave pranjal a very fair chance to explain his side so that we are not in the wrong. We said you explain your side and kaustubh said that if we are wrong we'll get you a beer
3/3/19, 9:34 PM - Jenit Jain: And also, he confessed he likes you.
3/3/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
3/3/19, 9:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Thank you
3/3/19, 10:00 PM - Jenit Jain: That's all you want to say?
3/3/19, 10:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's good
3/3/19, 10:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's fine
3/3/19, 10:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
3/3/19, 10:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Love you Jen don't not talk to me next time I feel damn sad
3/3/19, 10:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Let's see
3/3/19, 10:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Sorry not sorry for scratching your hand
3/3/19, 10:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Also did your mom pay 500 less to him
3/3/19, 10:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Because I have him 500
3/3/19, 10:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Please confirm with her
3/3/19, 10:19 PM - Jenit Jain: So that she can pay less tomorrow
3/3/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Hi Jen
3/3/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Sorry baby mom just slept
3/3/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: We were talking actually
3/3/19, 11:24 PM - Jenit Jain: It's fine
3/3/19, 11:24 PM - Jenit Jain: About what
3/3/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So she's damn smart as I had told you
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't worry she still likes you a lot
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: The thing is that she was awake
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: ButM
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: I knew it
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: While going and coming back
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Fair enough
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And she's taken your side through and through
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh well
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: But she didn't like the way I talk!
3/3/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: ?*
3/3/19, 11:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And she said that I was wrong in not making it absolutely clear and she understands why I didn't do it cause I'm from a girls school and I feel shy to talk about all these things and don't like confrontation and all
3/3/19, 11:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No no
3/3/19, 11:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She loved you
3/3/19, 11:27 PM - Jenit Jain: I also know this
3/3/19, 11:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She's given dry fruits to give to you
3/3/19, 11:27 PM - Jenit Jain: I shall gladly accept
3/3/19, 11:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell her that js
3/3/19, 11:27 PM - Jenit Jain: And sorry that she had to hear it
3/3/19, 11:27 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But she was sad that you were sullen on the trip
3/3/19, 11:27 PM - Jenit Jain: I had fun, tell her
3/3/19, 11:27 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Haan ok
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Jenit Jain: I love you.
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I shall
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I love you too sweetie
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What's the scene with Pranjal
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Jenit Jain: How are the scratches
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Did you insult him ?
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Jenit Jain: No talking no communication no existence. Everyone else is fine
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Jenit Jain: Duh
3/3/19, 11:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Or hit him or something
3/3/19, 11:29 PM - Jenit Jain: I nudged him
3/3/19, 11:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
3/3/19, 11:29 PM - Jenit Jain: I then concentrated on jayant and rishab
3/3/19, 11:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Got it
3/3/19, 11:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Cool
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I apologize for not making it clear to them
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Good
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But you should know that I tried
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Not hard enough clearly
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Jenit Jain: But okay
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Jenit Jain: At least you accept
3/3/19, 11:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And mom has asked me to tell you to stop being insecure and also to tell you that I am not untrustworthy
3/3/19, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Aiyo
3/3/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Because I spoke to her and she's like wah you tell him everything
3/3/19, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell her that I implied to one incident
3/3/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I was like ya
3/3/19, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Because you couldn't complete your part
3/3/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause I feel guilty to not tell
3/3/19, 11:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Why would she be surprised that you do. She's also like vidushi Kya 😂
3/3/19, 11:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She's like then good it is that you keep him in confidence but then why is he calling you untrustworthy
3/3/19, 11:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you explain only because you couldn't keep your part?
3/3/19, 11:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That does not make me untrustworthy
3/3/19, 11:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That makes me not open to confrontation
3/3/19, 11:33 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't confuse terms
3/3/19, 11:33 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Untrustworthy hurts because I have never ever lied to you ever
3/3/19, 11:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Because it feels like you don't even try. Because of the number of times, it has happened
3/3/19, 11:33 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And this I will never be open to confrontation in the future either
3/3/19, 11:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Just delayed info
3/3/19, 11:34 PM - Jenit Jain: Learn. I'm getting hurt because of you because of this more than enough
3/3/19, 11:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay got it 
I agree it's happened several times 
But each time you should understand that I don't think that it's such a big deal cause I don't give a shit and you do 
Mom also said ki tu usko batayi nahi ki terko farak nahi padta 
I said bataya but he's too easily affected so she's like oh 
She said just do it for his sake sometimes it's easier that way than actually changing your thought process
3/3/19, 11:37 PM - Jenit Jain: I didn't want your mom to know this side so early in a relationship according to her
3/3/19, 11:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not going to learn this 
You accept it 
I don't like making people feel bad about anything it sucks the enthusiasm from myself and I can't deal with the negative energy 
So no I will not 'learn' how to confront people 
I am not comfortable with it
3/3/19, 11:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What?
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's fine she likes you
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She understands
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Early relationship (according to her)
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But she understands me as well
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Per chue isliye
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Haha maybe
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine I'll confront peacefully for you
3/3/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: .
3/3/19, 11:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You wanna confront people okay do it 
But you should do it without insulating them cause then you're just removing anger and not making valid points
3/3/19, 11:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: This is an observation and not an assumption
3/3/19, 11:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I have seen it
3/3/19, 11:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
3/3/19, 11:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Last thing I have to say
3/3/19, 11:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: About what happened today
3/3/19, 11:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Exactly I know, but today I made sense because I was right. I said everything correctly because it is borderline harassment. No girl of mine is going to go through that under my watch.
3/3/19, 11:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Say
3/3/19, 11:45 PM - Jenit Jain: !!!!
3/3/19, 11:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't cry
3/3/19, 11:45 PM - Jenit Jain: And say
3/3/19, 11:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I want three apologies from you 
1. I don't know why the fuck you think it's okay to hit me when you're angry. I don't know when I made it okay to do it in your head. Okay, when you're doing it playfully I understand. But today it was in anger and I would've cried almost if mom wasn't sitting there and I didn't have to make you look good. Moreover I can't believe you said that you're not going to apologize for scratching me. And pushing my hand away and whatnot. Even if you were irritated you can't do that. This was not okay Jen. I'm really hurt. 
2. Please apologize for calling me untrustworthy you know I'm not. 
3. Apologize for your behaviour today. You knew it was my last day with mom. You knew I'm going to be sad tomorrow. You made me feel as if it would've been better to not invite both of you.

3/3/19, 11:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Thank you
3/3/19, 11:49 PM - Jenit Jain: You didn't even tell me you felt awkward or about the message itself
3/3/19, 11:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't tell me I had any end to keep
3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Jenit Jain: Make sure he stays as a friend
3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Jenit Jain: Was your end
3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I did that
3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Jenit Jain: You didn't keep it
3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I never felt anything
3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: For him

3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: How can I control his feelings
3/3/19, 11:50 PM - Jenit Jain: Ik

3/3/19, 11:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't understand what you mean then ?
3/3/19, 11:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Explain your end
3/3/19, 11:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Fucl it
It's over and decided. Fighting over it doesn't make sense
3/3/19, 11:52 PM - Jenit Jain: It is done and dusted
3/3/19, 11:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No it's not
3/3/19, 11:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Answer me
3/3/19, 11:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What did I do
3/3/19, 11:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That you called me untrustworthy
3/3/19, 11:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Oh wait I'm not done
3/3/19, 11:53 PM - Jenit Jain: He kept liking you and you didn't make sure by any means necessary that he stops. So I had to intervene because it's just a negative situation to be in for both of us
3/3/19, 11:53 PM - Dikshita Kothari: For the third one Jen thank you for being so fucking selfish 
I tried to do what was right by me 
To tell you what happened as soon as it was possible 
I'm sorry I was tired and wanted to sleep the previous night ? 
Should I have told you in the return journey ? You would've said then why you didn't tell me while coming.
3/3/19, 11:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't think it was negative for me and I don't know how it affected you so much
3/3/19, 11:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: 'any means necessary' is not my style as I have justified already in my non confrontation idea
3/3/19, 11:55 PM - Jenit Jain: I told you about sannidhi being weird once as soon as class got over and I met you
3/3/19, 11:56 PM - Jenit Jain: So I FUCKING HANDLED IT
3/3/19, 11:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't you dare call me dishonest / untrustworthy / disloyal ever again 
God knows I share what and how I share things with you like I would with my mother when the time is right and we have free time to talk about it
3/3/19, 11:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have a problem with that 
Pranjal crossed a line
3/3/19, 11:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine
3/3/19, 11:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Good
3/3/19, 11:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's your style not mine I will tell you everything when I think I need to tell you and talk about it
3/3/19, 11:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I cannot keep giving live update about everything in my life
3/3/19, 11:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's stupid and just not the way I do things
3/3/19, 11:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay then. I will really remember this.
3/3/19, 11:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
3/3/19, 11:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But I will surely tell you Jen don't forget
3/3/19, 11:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No need to be sarcastic/ condescending

3/4/19, 12:20 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But some things might not

3/4/19, 10:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Honestly I give up
3/4/19, 10:37 PM - Jenit Jain: If you get over it by tomorrow them meet me else tell me.
3/4/19, 10:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Because I'm not meeting you till you get over this and that is what I feel is right for us
3/4/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Also
3/4/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: This
3/4/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: And this
3/4/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: Are the same expenses
3/4/19, 10:42 PM - Jenit Jain: So twice it got deducted or what
3/4/19, 10:43 PM - Jenit Jain: From the 2 cards?
3/4/19, 10:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Plus the reason we always fight is pretty much uprooted. Thanks for showing the support for it
3/4/19, 10:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What ?
3/4/19, 10:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Nothing goodnight
3/4/19, 10:51 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm sorry but my patience has run out
3/4/19, 11:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
3/4/19, 11:03 PM - Jenit Jain: .
3/4/19, 11:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You feel wrong
3/4/19, 11:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I think you should try to understand my point of view
3/4/19, 11:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Pranjal I will definitely not talk cause you're not comfortable clearly
3/4/19, 11:04 PM - Jenit Jain: I understood. I saw how it works. I didn't like it and you didn't change it.
3/4/19, 11:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But then, again and again, the same thing is happening
3/4/19, 11:04 PM - Jenit Jain: What
3/4/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why should I even bother making friends if you're going to tell me to not talk to them or something like that 
Shouldn't you leave those decisions to me
3/4/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like being a puppet jen
3/4/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're my favourite
3/4/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I love you so much
3/4/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But you're not there with me all the time na
3/4/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I also need people around me
3/4/19, 11:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: To talk to or chill with or whatever
3/4/19, 11:08 PM - Jenit Jain: I never stop you from making friends. Yes I do speak very negative all the time but then I learned to stop. I can't help it if some of your friends are shits. You do realize that pranjal basically indirectly agreed that he took advantage of your naïve nature and kept on Pursuing. No one said a word but everyone there agreed
3/4/19, 11:08 PM - Jenit Jain: Other people also take advantage of that thing only
3/4/19, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Kshitij I don't like. But he still hasn't fucked up in any way so I don't even say about him
3/4/19, 11:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't think this way. I'm just guarding you. If you think this way then I can't help it
3/4/19, 11:13 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Tomorrow if I say that vidit is a bad influence on you 
All he's putting into your head all bullshit in your head 
You're around too much negativity 
Stop talking to him immediately 
I'm not comfortable with it 
Then what would you do ?
3/4/19, 11:14 PM - Jenit Jain: You're talking bs. What I made him do is confess in front of everyone.
3/4/19, 11:14 PM - Jenit Jain: He even got a turn to speak he just couldn't.
3/4/19, 11:15 PM - Jenit Jain: You take it as a compromise or whatever. It's done. No one is going to change it. All you can do is accept it.
3/4/19, 11:15 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll do the same thing if I have to if it's necessary.
3/4/19, 11:15 PM - Jenit Jain: But rn it's clearly not
3/4/19, 11:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Everyone already knew Jen
3/4/19, 11:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You leave Pranjal for a moment
3/4/19, 11:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Generally think for anyone
3/4/19, 11:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: For example if Kshitij makes a mistake 
I will come and tell you first 
Your solution will be - stop talking to him he's a little shit
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And then you'll go and scare him so he's going to stop talking to me also
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Now Kshitij will stop means Shashank will also stop
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Jenit Jain: So move past it and text me.
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Jenit Jain: I can't help it if all your bonds are through people
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Stop blaming me
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's just one more semester
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm not taking any of it
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell yourself that
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not blaming you baba
3/4/19, 11:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Then they were complex anyway
3/4/19, 11:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Great
3/4/19, 11:17 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm done here
3/4/19, 11:17 PM - Jenit Jain: TRULY.
3/4/19, 11:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Text me when you get over the biggest mistake of my life
3/4/19, 11:17 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm not replying here anymore
3/4/19, 11:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Feel free to send as many messages t

3/4/19, 11:17 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even want to talk Jen
3/4/19, 11:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even want to listen to my problem
3/4/19, 11:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And your solution isn't even a solution it's an ultimatum
3/4/19, 11:20 PM - Jenit Jain: I will give you the same explanation because it's true.
3/4/19, 11:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't mind being called naive. It's okay if people think I am. I will help them in whatever way I can. You are not letting me be a happy go lucky person. I am feeling pretty suffocated. 
Why won't you let me have a little control over my life and my friends.
3/4/19, 11:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Your problem is not worth listening too because nothing in your class will change
3/4/19, 11:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I listened with saurak and Parth and I left them
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can count my friends in one hand Jen
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Well if you're feeling suffocated you shouldn't
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Go out and do whatever you want
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Jenit Jain: I have told you what needs to be donem
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Stop typing I'm talking
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: This isn't a solution Jen
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Rest is your decision
3/4/19, 11:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Same
3/4/19, 11:22 PM - Jenit Jain: You answer my call
3/4/19, 11:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why don't you understand my nature ?

3/4/19, 11:22 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't wanna text
3/4/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If you don't care then there's no need to talk to me
3/4/19, 11:24 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
3/4/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: My side is not even worthy enough for you to pay attention for five minutes
3/4/19, 11:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Goodnight I love you.
3/4/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I love you too

3/4/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like this behaviour
3/4/19, 11:38 PM - Jenit Jain: If you think so
3/4/19, 11:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're being difficult
3/4/19, 11:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Think about me. I get hurt. I solve the reason that hurt me and then you hurt me again

3/4/19, 11:41 PM - Jenit Jain: So was somiya.
3/4/19, 11:41 PM - Jenit Jain: You don't see me crying about it.
3/4/19, 11:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Dude you liked her back and she was the one who said I won't talk to you anymore Jen don't even bring somiya up cause you were wrong in that through and through and then also I just let it go without giving you any bt like this
3/4/19, 11:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You were the one who decided that you're not going to talk to somiya
3/4/19, 11:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't force any of my decisions on you

3/4/19, 11:43 PM - Jenit Jain: Honestly I have heard his name enough time after I told you it's done. You must really cherish him. Thanks for lying about the complex part. I'm done. You text me now, I'll block you. Instead, just wish me goodnight. Think everything through and when you've made your peace with it, text me
3/4/19, 11:43 PM - Jenit Jain: And you're being petty now.
3/4/19, 11:43 PM - Jenit Jain: Stop talking to hsrshit and arav and all

Pranjal didn't do anything. I may be naive but I'm not going to allow you to break a good friendship for a stupid ego issue that will not affect anyone in the long run.
3/6/19, 10:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's becoming pretty difficult
3/6/19, 10:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Love you too sweetie
3/6/19, 10:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But when you're wrong you're wrong

3/6/19, 10:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Divya even
3/6/19, 10:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: From any girls point of view
3/6/19, 10:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You're wrong
3/6/19, 10:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: All your friends have to support you cause well they're all men
3/6/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And your male ego and possessiveness is justified among them
3/6/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I will not take this bs anymore Jen
3/6/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm pretty tired of trying to convince you
3/6/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You know I love you
3/6/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And I'll never love anyone else
3/6/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: All this is doing is giving me solid bt for any other time I decide to make a friend
3/6/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need protection from pranjall
3/6/19, 11:14 AM - Jenit Jain: Doesn't matters
3/6/19, 11:14 AM - Jenit Jain: It's done now
3/6/19, 11:14 AM - Jenit Jain: You accept it
3/6/19, 11:14 AM - Jenit Jain: Next time such a thing happens and when you get the chance, you handle it properly
3/6/19, 11:15 AM - Jenit Jain: This is done
3/6/19, 11:15 AM - Jenit Jain: Move on
3/6/19, 11:15 AM - Jenit Jain: You weren't going to talk to him 6months later anyway like you said
3/6/19, 11:15 AM - Jenit Jain: So why waste any more timr
3/6/19, 11:15 AM - Jenit Jain: It's done and finalized
3/6/19, 11:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No
3/6/19, 11:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not done
3/6/19, 11:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And neither are you
3/6/19, 11:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Allow me to talk to him
3/6/19, 11:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: That's all I'm asking
3/6/19, 11:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Is it so much
3/6/19, 11:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Do you want this to affect us in the future
3/6/19, 11:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Before it wasn't
3/6/19, 11:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Now it will
3/6/19, 11:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Unless you stop it
3/6/19, 11:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause somehow you have so much power over me
3/6/19, 11:31 AM - Jenit Jain: Fine then let it affect
3/6/19, 11:31 AM - Jenit Jain: Or you stop
3/6/19, 11:31 AM - Jenit Jain: It's not ego talking
3/6/19, 11:31 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No you stop
3/6/19, 11:31 AM - Dikshita Kothari: EGO
3/6/19, 11:31 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Your ego is becoming bigger than our relationship
3/6/19, 11:31 AM - Dikshita Kothari: There are people who will always spread rumours about you. There are people who will always cause drama involving you, but the only thing you can do is RISE ABOVE THEM AND SMILE. Tell yourself , that despite all you stand strong. I have heard the lies, though I speak only truth. I was thrown to hell but I built my own heaven. I have restored my strength so none can shake my grounds. At the end of the day stand up for what you believe in even if it means standing alone. Good morning.
3/6/19, 11:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Please tell your mom that you're old enough to fight for yourself
3/6/19, 11:34 AM - Jenit Jain: She's not making it any better
3/6/19, 11:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Dikshiya my decision is final no matter what you say.
3/6/19, 11:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Keep that in mind
3/6/19, 11:35 AM - Jenit Jain: And them decide how you want to spend your revels
3/6/19, 11:35 AM - Jenit Jain: With me or without
3/6/19, 11:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Because I don't want you in bt during your events
3/6/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: She thinks so but you don't ?
3/6/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I will be in vt
3/6/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And you would've caused it
3/6/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't you see how stupid you're being
3/6/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You're too adamant to see
3/6/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You're being as stupid as you were in 11/12
3/6/19, 11:37 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Do you hate me ?
3/6/19, 11:37 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Lunch at 1

3/7/19, 9:12 AM - Jenit Jain: Green cos I'm sad that my gf fights with me
3/7/19, 9:15 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Red and Blue cause I'm angry and sad that I have no control
3/7/19, 9:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Green is for guilty
3/7/19, 9:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So I'm going to go with you're finally feeling guilty
3/7/19, 9:17 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm wearing blue also
3/7/19, 9:17 AM - Jenit Jain: Green not counted
3/7/19, 9:17 AM - Jenit Jain: I read wrong
3/7/19, 9:18 AM - Jenit Jain: You realise how embarrassed I'll be if I tell hasn't pranjal baat karle. My image is gonna go in the dirt
3/7/19, 9:18 AM - Jenit Jain: Do you want that
3/7/19, 9:31 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Image in front of whom , my class people?? 
Also, why do you want your image to be of someone who doesn't allow their girlfriend to talk to people 
Image means ego 
You're breaking my friendship cause you have too much ego 
What about my image 
According to my image now I'm a stupid girl whose life is controlled by her boyfriend. Who can't stand up for herself? And who chooses a boyfriend to fight her battles for her. I want my image to be of someone chill and sweet. Didn't you like me cause I was sweet? That was the only thing in my personality. Dikshita is very sweet. And now dikshita is not even sweet anymore. Dikshita is a puppet and everyone hates her cause she doesn't stand up for what she feels is right. She just listens to someone else. Cause she doesn't have a choice. 
The most important thing in her life is jenit. She does whatever jenit wants and however he wants her to do it. If jenit told her to drop ice cream on her shirt otherwise he will break up with her she will drop that ice cream cause she is too scared to lose him. She knows jenit is insecure but she doesn't know why and she is frankly tired of massaging his ego and letting hers just become non-existent. 
But after all this also jenit will be too "embarrassed" by his girlfriend. Cause his girlfriend is a dumb fool who wants to do right by everyone and not make anyone sad. She tries her best but ultimately has to do what jenit says cause otherwise jenit will be too "embarrassed". Dikshita is not only embarrassed by what has happened she's also sad, guilty, angry, confused, empty, unenthusiastic. But jenit is embarrassed. So dikshita must listen to what he has to say otherwise jenit will leave her. 
Can I talk to my friend? Why can't I talk? Mom brought a pen for Pranjal can I give it to him? Can I say what I want or will jenit feel bad if I talk? 
These are the questions I have to ask you in the future? Then the future is seeming very difficult for me jenit. And to me, it's now looking like an old Marwari family where the wife has to cover her head and sit while the man does all the work cause he is trying to "protect" her.
3/7/19, 9:32 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I probably won't make it to 10:30 class
3/7/19, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Wow you just took it way far ahead
3/7/19, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: And yes, Jenit will feel very bad if you talk
3/7/19, 9:35 AM - Jenit Jain: You're just exaggerating everything now
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not exaggerating anything
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: This is how I feel
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And this is what is going to happen in the future
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Jenit Jain: You presume to know everything.
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Jenit Jain: Great
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Jenit will say no that place is too far don't go there to work I can't protect you there
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And I will listen
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: That's my future
3/7/19, 9:36 AM - Jenit Jain: Stop this bs

3/7/19, 9:37 AM - Jenit Jain: You're just overthinking
3/7/19, 9:37 AM - Jenit Jain: And not making sense
3/7/19, 9:37 AM - Jenit Jain: And just making bad allegations
3/7/19, 9:37 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Then you will say go for work but don't talk to anyone cause they're weird people chi
3/7/19, 9:37 AM - Dikshita Kothari: This is how I feel
3/7/19, 9:37 AM - Jenit Jain: One time I'm asking you to do something severe
3/7/19, 9:37 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And how I will feel for a very long time
3/7/19, 9:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Great
3/7/19, 9:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I have never asked you to do anything
3/7/19, 9:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And you shouldn't be asking me either
3/7/19, 9:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Sure.
3/7/19, 9:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: What have I asked you tell any one thing
3/7/19, 9:38 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm asking you as a bf. You decide what you want to do
3/7/19, 9:39 AM - Jenit Jain: I can't remember now
3/7/19, 9:39 AM - Jenit Jain: But I'm sure 3 years Mai I have done enough
3/7/19, 9:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause there was nothing that you would remember forever
3/7/19, 9:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No decision that I forced on you
3/7/19, 9:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You've done a lot for me Jen
3/7/19, 9:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But I didn't ask for anything
3/7/19, 9:39 AM - Jenit Jain: I just accepted anything you say because you're smart most of the time
3/7/19, 9:40 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Except weed and that is just shitty
3/7/19, 9:40 AM - Jenit Jain: Cool. I get how it works. Next time you need me to do something make sure you ask for it. You don't want good gestures so be it
3/7/19, 9:40 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't do anything cause otherwise, you will leave me isn't it
3/7/19, 9:40 AM - Jenit Jain: That's why I didn't bring it up
3/7/19, 9:41 AM - Jenit Jain: Idk
3/7/19, 9:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You don't want to leave weed?
3/7/19, 9:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Go go
3/7/19, 9:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Smoke as much as you want
3/7/19, 9:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't blame it on me
3/7/19, 9:41 AM - Jenit Jain: I left that's why you didn't say anything and I don't think it was a bad decision on your part either so why criticize
3/7/19, 9:42 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You've done a lot for me Jen I know it.
3/7/19, 9:42 AM - Jenit Jain: No more

3/7/19, 9:43 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't even say anything anymore without you becoming angry with me or threatening to break up or anything
3/7/19, 9:44 AM - Jenit Jain: I didn't even threaten
3/7/19, 9:44 AM - Jenit Jain: Becoming angry is plausible
3/7/19, 9:44 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You said you won't do anything for me anymore

3/7/19, 10:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You should take part now also
3/7/19, 10:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Give a parcel to udupi but mostly not get annoyed by you agakn
3/7/19, 10:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Morning morning Mai you ruin the mood
3/7/19, 10:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: For these fights, you shouldn't give up a good experience
3/7/19, 10:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But I don't have a say in what you do anyway
3/7/19, 10:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So do what you want
3/7/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Annoying irritating
3/7/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Anything else?
3/7/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Do what you want man
3/7/19, 10:58 AM - Jenit Jain: Never said that. Again with these presumptions
3/7/19, 10:58 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So then you should do events
3/7/19, 10:58 AM - Dikshita Kothari: How many times I've told you this
3/7/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Haan but I annoy you
3/7/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I understand
3/7/19, 10:59 AM - Jenit Jain: You stop with this fight then. It's annoying and I can't be productive because of it
3/7/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You stop it
3/7/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Why should I stop it
3/7/19, 11:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't even want to go to class anymore
3/7/19, 11:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's "annoying" to feel like this
3/7/19, 11:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Fine I'll put a pause
3/7/19, 11:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If you come for revels
3/7/19, 11:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Otherwise I'll keep "annoying" you
3/7/19, 11:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Pause
3/7/19, 11:03 AM - Jenit Jain: I don't want it at all. Dikshita it's done. It ain't change now why don't you understand. You want me to go tell a guy to talk to my gf after threatening him?
3/7/19, 11:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes, indeed, you didn't get it your way but it's not like I didn't give you a chance. So stop being so aggressive with me. Your friend couldn't handle your friendship which affevtrd me. If that friendship meant so much for him he would have preserved it instead of being a lover boy for years. Dikshita it had to be done. Please stop fighting.
3/7/19, 11:22 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to tell him anything
3/7/19, 11:22 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'll talk directly
3/7/19, 11:27 AM - Jenit Jain: You had enough opportunities. So nothing will be done now. Moreover, we didnt even hit him. It would have been only so much better if you did it yourself
3/7/19, 11:27 AM - Jenit Jain: So dw about that
3/7/19, 11:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't give me a chance 
If it was going to become so serious and you would've told me I would've fixed it a little more harsh manner mein not broken the friendship altogether that's a very wrong thing that happened. If it had to be done I would realize it. It didn't have to be done and it was unnecessary. We were so happy before this. Now it's like you've done something I'll never forget. Cause it's hurt me so much. You can't tell me when to stop fighting and when to not. 
Jenit I was so simple and easy. Doing all this you're making me a very complex person. I don't like myself right now how can I expect you to love me. Let me do things my way. I told you not to interfere and you didn't even do that. You are acting difficult. I let everything go that's why you think it's okay to do what you did but it's not. And I'm angry with you and sad for everything else. We were so happy Jen. Nothing was wrong. You didn't have to do this and ruin everything.
3/7/19, 11:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I want to do it myself now
3/7/19, 11:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Fix or unfix
3/7/19, 11:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's my choice
3/7/19, 11:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Not yours
3/7/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I came for 11:30 class
3/7/19, 11:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Lunch if you want
3/7/19, 11:40 AM - Jenit Jain: So you do agree not doing anything. You didn't even consider my advice to tell me him keep his distance. Youndid everything for so long at your own accord which is practically nothing. Then you lie and say you tried to fix it and I believed you. So don't blame if your carelessness cost you a friendship. You basically confessed of it being your fault.
3/7/19, 11:40 AM - Jenit Jain: So yes don't fight now
3/7/19, 11:41 AM - Jenit Jain: Maybe we were way happier in the past because everything worked according to your needs only
3/7/19, 11:42 AM - Jenit Jain: All this you won't see. Itna time I supported you because I thought you would support me by talking to him and telling him to calm the fuck down. You clearly didn't see my problem and certainly didn't act on it. So I'm doing the same now. I'm not going to change my decision.
3/7/19, 11:43 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre if course I talked to him
3/7/19, 11:43 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't lie
3/7/19, 11:43 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But no situation needs such harsh handling
3/7/19, 11:45 AM - Jenit Jain: It wasn't harsh man
3/7/19, 11:45 AM - Jenit Jain: I didn't beat him up
3/7/19, 11:45 AM - Jenit Jain: It was apt
3/7/19, 11:44 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You supported me what do you want me to tell you
Thank you so much Jen I know you do a lot for me I know it really. But like if you didn't want to support me you tell me that
3/7/19, 11:45 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And then I do something about it
3/7/19, 11:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No no no
3/7/19, 11:48 AM - Jenit Jain: I supported you. Now your turn to support me
3/7/19, 11:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I could've done that
3/7/19, 11:48 AM - Jenit Jain: I gave you many chances dik
3/7/19, 11:49 AM - Jenit Jain: You didn't take any of them seriously
3/7/19, 11:49 AM - Jenit Jain: How's that's my fault
3/7/19, 11:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I always support you but not here when you're wrong
3/7/19, 11:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You tell me one situation in which you told me to do anything like Sunday
3/7/19, 11:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't think it would affect you so much
3/7/19, 11:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't know you were so insecure
3/7/19, 11:50 AM - Jenit Jain: You know how much it affects seeing that this is the main reason we fighting
3/7/19, 11:50 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm not insecure
3/7/19, 11:50 AM - Jenit Jain: You know that
3/7/19, 11:51 AM - Jenit Jain: It's just that extra thing nudging our relationship
3/7/19, 11:53 AM - Jenit Jain: Deep about this. I trust you enough. BUT YOU DIDNT TAKE ME SERIOUSLY AFTER EXPRESSINH MY CONCERNS MULTIPLE TIME HENCE YOU GAVE ME NO CHOICE. YOU CANT EVEN SAY THAT YOU THOUGHT IT DIDNT AFFRCT ME. WE FUCKING FIGHT FOR LEGIT USUALLY FOR THIS ONLY. So I'm sorry you couldn't take my reaction for how serious they always were. Because clearly you don't think I can get pissed at you. It's literally your fault that you didn't handle it. How many times am I supposed to even say. You don't listen only. next time maybe I say something and you'll actually take it seriously, maybe.
3/7/19, 12:08 PM - Jenit Jain: Reply
3/7/19, 12:16 PM - Dikshita Kothari: We never used to fight about this
3/7/19, 12:18 PM - Jenit Jain: We always fought about your annoying classmates and lover boys
3/7/19, 12:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Since you are so adamant about your part and I'm more adamant about my part. And I made a decision for you, you go do anything you want. Even I'll see what you can do. And I also insist you talk to harshit and arav since they share a similar pov and you wanted to know who is on my side.
3/7/19, 12:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Dekthe hai what you do.
3/7/19, 12:51 PM - Jenit Jain: So go, do.
3/7/19, 12:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Remember, it will be causing you to be my alibi when I try to destroy pranjals college life. And you will be on the spot then also, plus it will hurt our relationship even more. Plus he's gonna get his ass handed to him
3/7/19, 1:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Also how about you tell your mom about the s and p thing
3/7/19, 1:00 PM - Jenit Jain: And then the board game day
3/7/19, 1:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Since you anyway include her so much in our relationship give her a full view na she can actually judge me with the whole picture
3/7/19, 12:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Now only we're fighting about this
3/7/19, 12:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Before we never fought about that
3/7/19, 12:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't handle it I did handle it I know I handled it 
He was not irritating me at all 
We were fine !
3/7/19, 12:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: He never used to push like that
3/7/19, 12:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I never felt anything
3/7/19, 12:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I don't
3/7/19, 12:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Nothing we ever fought about Pranjal

3/7/19, 1:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Right
3/7/19, 1:02 PM - Jenit Jain: Sure haan
3/7/19, 1:02 PM - Jenit Jain: I wonder how I've kept my feeling of punching him in the face so many times. I'm sure I've shared them with you
3/7/19, 1:02 PM - Jenit Jain: So I know it has come up
3/7/19, 1:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Reply
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have a choice only
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I have the right to make my own decisions
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Jenit Jain: And you could have
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Jenit Jain: You failed
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You ruined everything and you're so satisfied with yourself
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You are not the judge of that
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't irritate me
3/7/19, 1:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I have an event

3/7/19, 1:18 PM - Jenit Jain: And yesterday toh you also said you shouldn't have told me only about the message. I wonder how many times he's flirted with you and all and you didn't tell me about it. I'm sure there are ton of such incidents
3/7/19, 1:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I wish there were
3/7/19, 1:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: At least I would still have my friend
3/7/19, 1:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Unfortunately I feel too guilty to not share anything with you
3/7/19, 1:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So I tell you everything
3/7/19, 1:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And since you've scolded me so many times for me not telling you
3/7/19, 1:18 PM - Jenit Jain: You can't expect me to believe this.
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's become like a habit to first ask and tell jenit whatever is happening
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Jenit Jain: I still know that you haven't told things that you were just like choti baat hai.
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't believe
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm a liar
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I'm untrustworthy
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And that makes me clever
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Jenit Jain: You made me get this habit
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Clever enough to handle my shit on my own
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Jenit Jain: But not sharing
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Jenit Jain: No
3/7/19, 1:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I wish I'd not shared anything
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: At least I would like the relationship I'm in
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Keep saying such things. Really improves things
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Haan I will
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Your fault
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You ruined everything
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Wow so now don't even like the relationship great
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You sit and think how you ruined it
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Really improves
3/7/19, 1:20 PM - Jenit Jain: I didn't if you'd just accept the inevitable
3/7/19, 1:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Who knows I'm a liar right
3/7/19, 1:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No you think
3/7/19, 1:21 PM - Jenit Jain: True
3/7/19, 1:21 PM - Jenit Jain: ITS DONE
3/7/19, 1:23 PM - Jenit Jain: You tell me when you'll stop hating me and stop blaming me and see the big picture, then I'll invite you to pp
3/7/19, 1:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I never needed an invite before
3/7/19, 1:28 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Now I do
3/7/19, 1:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You changed everything
3/7/19, 1:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And ruined everything
3/7/19, 1:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And you were wrong
3/7/19, 1:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You accept it and move on
3/7/19, 1:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Because of today's right
3/7/19, 1:30 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm not accepting it and moving on. This time youre doing it. I'm not doing the hard part. I have never won a fight and I always apologise because I realise it. This time I won't apologise because I know what I did Is fine.
3/7/19, 1:30 PM - Jenit Jain: So dikshita this fight will never end till you accept it. You have the power.
3/7/19, 1:31 PM - Jenit Jain: I insist as my bf to not talk to him and not fight with me but since you deserve to make your own decisions, i hope you select the right thing.

3/9/19, 8:53 PM - Jenit Jain: So it's just not me
3/9/19, 8:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita everyone knows you're the person whose fault it is
3/9/19, 8:54 PM - Jenit Jain: I agree the decision making freedom is necessary, but if you take 1.5 years to say no (which you clearly didn't do as said by him) then I will do what's necessary. Moreover I told you everything I will do. You should be very fucking lucky I didn't beat him to pulp
3/9/19, 8:54 PM - Jenit Jain: So be grateful
3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I need time

3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Otherwise I will intervene
3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Jenit Jain: For what?
3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Accept it?
3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If everyone thinks I'm wrong then maybe I am
3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But I've not understood how
3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I'm being able to understand the way you're telling
3/9/19, 8:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Exactly what I'm trying to do baby
3/9/19, 8:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Huh
3/9/19, 8:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Not*
3/9/19, 8:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm just saying
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You should've let me come to the conclusion on my own
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You can't help me everywhere
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay, then since you don't want to talk to my Bois so the only option you have is it accept it. You'll eventually get it. And then you'll know how to handle such situations in the future ( kill the problem in the womb before it becomes a big problem)
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Didn't really help you
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Jenit Jain: I helped me and the relationship
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Jenit Jain: That's why no regrets
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're just being selfish
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's fine
3/9/19, 8:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm also being selfish
3/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Dikshitanyou ducking didn't come to a conclusion for 3 sems, you weren't going to come up with one now.
3/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: And even if there was a conclusion to this, you wouldn't have applied it
3/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Because it fucking includes confrontay
3/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: That you don't have the balls to do
3/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: So you don't blame me
3/9/19, 8:58 PM - Jenit Jain: You got a very good chance to handle it
3/9/19, 8:59 PM - Jenit Jain: But "you never said" FUCKING  "no"
3/9/19, 8:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I WILL DECIDE THAT NOT YOU ARE YOU STUPID
3/9/19, 8:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You know I did
3/9/19, 8:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Not clear enough, clearly since he had the balls to tell you directly
3/9/19, 8:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Next time such a thing happens, know the background
3/9/19, 9:00 PM - Jenit Jain: 1.5 years of liking is not healthy for me or relationship
3/9/19, 9:00 PM - Jenit Jain: But I clearly remember you saying you're toh enjoying it because it's basically a compliment
3/9/19, 9:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Next time you don't want to break friendships then don't "enjoy " pronlems
3/9/19, 9:01 PM - Jenit Jain: You really should learn how to prioritize your life
3/9/19, 9:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre exactly I don't care naaa I kept him as a friend and nothing more. Why will I go and stop people who compliment me. Jen you don't have to be so insecure.
3/9/19, 9:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes and you don't have to be so open about other people liking you.
3/9/19, 9:03 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll be insecure if I'm scared that you'll leave.
3/9/19, 9:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Not when he flirts
3/9/19, 9:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Please get your words correct.
3/9/19, 9:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'll not leave you know that
3/9/19, 9:04 PM - Jenit Jain: Exactly
3/9/19, 9:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Then why are you insecure
3/9/19, 9:05 PM - Jenit Jain: .
3/9/19, 9:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: People will like me in the future
3/9/19, 9:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What words
3/9/19, 9:05 PM - Jenit Jain: You really never listen from your mistakes
3/9/19, 9:05 PM - Jenit Jain: It's not insecure when I'm annoyed by the opposite person and not my gf
3/9/19, 9:05 PM - Jenit Jain: And you'll again not tell them to be like bro back the fuck off
3/9/19, 9:05 PM - Jenit Jain: And we'll have this problem again
3/9/19, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: I've seen that you clearly never learn from your mistakes
3/9/19, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Definitely not going to get any easier with long distance.
3/9/19, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: So dikshita you get balls
3/9/19, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: And start being stern with the people who need to be stern with.
3/9/19, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: And not the ones YOU THINK that need to be stern with
3/9/19, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Cos you clearly can't tell the difference
3/9/19, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: So going back 1.5 years, this is all your fault.
3/9/19, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: So while my relationship was getting affected for so much time you were having fun, and when o decide to alleviate my problem you're like wtf
3/9/19, 9:07 PM - Jenit Jain: That's not how it works
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What do you want from me ?
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You tell me this full and final
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I know you don't want me to talk to Pranjal
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I spoke to him and told him everything I had to say and I have nothing else to say
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So I have no business of talking to him anymore cause he's told me that he isn't going to get over me and I told him that if he doesn't then I can't even ask Jen to let me talk
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's why since morning
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Whatever you said I agreed
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But just asked for talking terms
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause throwing people out of my life I can't do
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I know how it feels if it's done to you
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I learnt this from Karan
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I know I'll never be happy if I do something like this
3/9/19, 9:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why do you have such a big problem if I ended my memories with Pranjal on a good note instead of a bad one
3/9/19, 9:09 PM - Jenit Jain: When did he say that
3/9/19, 9:09 PM - Jenit Jain: You didn't tell me
3/9/19, 9:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Yet I'm the one being screamed at and pushed and thrown around and asked to leave and whatnot. Aap seedhe muh se baat bhi nahi karte Jen. Aapka gussa is too much.
3/9/19, 9:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Because you embarrassed me, yet again
3/9/19, 9:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Cos you always keep my needs side Mai and usually do everything to piss me off while making sure that you will 100% not do what I ask you to do
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre if you had a problem and it was affecting you so much and since the beginning itself you should have removed it then itself like you did with Sanidhya. But no you let my friendship grow and then decided to hurt me so much. He was my best friend jenit. Not good
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I will embarrass you again and again and again
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't let me talk I feel scared to talk when you're angry I forgot everything. I wasn't leaving cause I wasn't done with the convo
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But no
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RN
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Reminds you of some one ?
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Agrim Sharma ?
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I embarrassed you for my peace of mind
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I got it
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're being selfish af
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So was I
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't think what I did made anything worse than it already is
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't speak to Arav Harshit cause you've already spoken to them
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's not in my hand
3/9/19, 9:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay I'll make a list. You star it and follow it.
1) if i ask you to not talk to someone, I've thought about it so that your tiny brain doesn't have to do anything.
2) remember that once I talk to the other person and tell them to stay away from you and you go and talk to them, IT FUCKING DESTROYS MY CREDIBILITY, IMAGE AND MODT OF ALL IT SHOWS OUTSIDERS AND ME HOW MUCH SHIT YOU GIVE ABOUT MY FEELINGS. 
3) I'm also tired of your delayed info. Why did you have to wait till we came till pp. You could have told me as soon as class got over. I need you to tell me asap. Not fuck around in between and then give bt. Country inn day also you waited till 10pm.
3/9/19, 9:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Take that best friend and shove him in your arse then why don't you
3/9/19, 9:16 PM - Jenit Jain: I didn't interfere BECAUSE YOU FUCKING TOLD ME YOULL HANDLE IT.
3/9/19, 9:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Stop acting stupid, you know this is the reason.
3/9/19, 9:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Only reason I interfered was because of your failure
3/9/19, 9:17 PM - Jenit Jain: Never again. I. DARE. YOU.
3/9/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: HOW DARE YOU ASK ME TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN AFTER HIM SAYING HE'LL NEVER GET OVER YOU
3/9/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: You know how shitty that makes you sound
3/9/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Filthy
3/9/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Disgusting
3/9/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Rubbish
3/9/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Exactly the words I'd use for your friendship with him as well
3/9/19, 9:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Pure selfish.
3/9/19, 9:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I said I can't ask jenit to let me talk to you if you're not going to get over me
3/9/19, 9:19 PM - Jenit Jain: We were happy for the past few days after you said fine I won't talk to him
3/9/19, 9:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I couldn't do it
3/9/19, 9:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What will you do
3/9/19, 9:19 PM - Jenit Jain: Theyd explain the same things since you clearly don't understand my pov
3/9/19, 9:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Repercussions in the relationship
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Take a break from a relationship next time you embarrass me.
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's anyway happening
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Not counting fights.
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: How will it become worse
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm taking a break now
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: All you do is shout at me
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Jenit Jain: But then you fucking kept asking me to let you talk to him
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Greay
3/9/19, 9:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I said talking terms
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: So next time I'll directly break up. Good.
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Nothing doing.
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So easy Jen
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: You do such things
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: No
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So easy for you to say that
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: But necessary
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Saying is easy doing is hard but will be necessary
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Did you expect me to find it easy to give up a friendship
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Otherwise you'll just take advantage of me every step of the way to get your way
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Jenit Jain: No
3/9/19, 9:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Your definition of necessary I've seen
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Jenit Jain: But your own fault
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't blame me for jack shit
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay jenit
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Guess what
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay.
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Everything is my fault
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Jenit Jain: True
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I take full responsibility for it
3/9/19, 9:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Shove that sarcasm up your arse next to pranjal
3/9/19, 9:24 PM - Jenit Jain: You haven't even owned up to a single thing since this thing started. Or even in the past. Sharam rakho
3/9/19, 9:24 PM - Jenit Jain: Reply
3/9/19, 9:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Also you got a fair turn when we sat outside. So don't give me any of this not being able to complete bs

3/9/19, 9:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Not negotiable
3/9/19, 9:29 PM - Jenit Jain: All the times you've embarrassed me, all times you were wrong and still fought about it like this one.
3/9/19, 9:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Agree to this or we're done here.
3/9/19, 9:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: 1. I will decide if to follow or not 
2. What's my image in front of anyone Jen ? Nothing. Absolutely. I don't want to destroy your credibility. But you legit don't give me an option. You have to give me an option not an ultimatum or a blackmail ka thing. 
3. Always remember. You told me about the somiya thing after everything was over. 
Also I told you late cause I know you'd react like this and I was contemplating whether to tell you or not. But then I felt too guilty and had to tell.
3/9/19, 9:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I give bt
3/9/19, 9:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You give me more bt

3/9/19, 9:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And now I have to see for 3 people and all of those as well who I will embarrass you in front of
3/9/19, 9:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Moreover, somiya thing yes. I will own up to everything because I fucked up. Yes I told you after it's over. Mainly because I didn't know what exactly to say. We were pretty clueless ourselves
3/9/19, 9:33 PM - Jenit Jain: .
3/9/19, 9:33 PM - Jenit Jain: .
3/9/19, 9:33 PM - Jenit Jain: .

3/9/19, 9:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I wasn't being sarcastic
3/9/19, 9:35 PM - Jenit Jain: Are you sure you're not going to follow these 3 rules then?
3/9/19, 9:35 PM - Jenit Jain: You don't accept anything.
3/9/19, 9:35 PM - Jenit Jain: Didn't*
3/9/19, 9:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I can't 
You're asking me for my freedom literally

In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

3/16/19, 6:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Respected Sir/ Ma'am,
I'm Jenit Jain, studying in my 3rd year of Computer Science and Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology.
I was intrigued by your company and I would love to be a part of your team.
I have been studying Artificial intelligence since my first year and haven't looked back. I have implemented several algorithms with success, have past experience working with LSTM and CNN models, did an internship where I was responsible for building models to solve problems related to computer vision and automating tasks by extracting information through data mining. I'm also working towards a minor in Intelligent Systems.
I would be obliged if I get an opportunity to work with your company and help build real-life solutions.
Thank you.

3/29/19, 5:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: [29/03, 5:06 PM] Papa: No one wants you to be hassled. 
The airline must have changed to this option as the best option available else why would they trouble you. 
Further now the situation is such that Jet Airways and Spice Jet many aircraft have been grounded due to defects in their Boeing airline. 
So be happy that you reached and you will reach Chennai safely else nowadays Jet does not even inform cancellation of the flight. 
We are booked while returning to Jet. I am apprehensive about this and have taken indigo as optional also as I need to reach Kolkata on 6th is the first day of Navratri
[29/03, 5:07 PM] Dikshita Kothari: I don't know where to file customer complaints otherwise I would've given them a piece of my mind 
This is absolutely nonsensical 
I have checked already there are other flights with less flying time. Simply they're doing this.
[29/03, 5:09 PM] Papa: You find out and tell me I will raise the issue if so . 
Find out now and tell me if there is a connecting flight Indigo or spice or any other without change that takes you to Chennai in less time

No road is long with good company. And difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. It was a long drive but worth it. 

We are settled comfortably in our rooms. Our resort is very picturesque - spacious log cottages skewed around a giant lawn. I'm sharing a room with Krishiv and Samriddh. Krishiv has finished his scrapbook work for the day and is exploring the WiFi password of the resort. Samriddh is giving the finishing touches. 

We had a yummy lunch at Pizza Hut. On the bus, we caught up on our beauty sleep. And then we played games - 
Volleyball without a ball
Two truths and one lie! 
Head-Up Vocal
Heads Up Actions

Manasvi and Kanishk were jammed plenty. 

Yana is the captain of the team 'The Order of the Phonix' and Meghomala is heading 'The Superiors'. 

The day belonged to the Order. But tomorrow is another day. 

All the kids have downloaded the App Your hour to track their phone usage. Three of the older, prettier, more handsome young adults(names withheld on request) who had more than 3 1/2 hours online logs have been punished. They will be the water carriers tomorrow when we scale the daunting Lion Rock. 

Meghomala and Krishiv won the prizes for being the lightest travellers. On a long journey, even a feather weighs like a stone. I can't wait to hear the water carriers' experiences tomorrow! 

Tomorrow's plan is 6, 7 and 8 am. 

Powerpacks devoured, Dinner ingested. Lying like sloths in our Travelicious t-shirts. Savouring the day gone by. 

I'm already beginning to trust this journey. 

Until tomorrow...
Shhhh.....
Samriddh is snoozing.

Animals are such agreeable friends - they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms. 

But what if the animal is a 6 ft long, fat python! 

We had many close, wild encounters today. As we ascended the Lion Rock, a monkey made off with Yana's Tang. Later, we chanced upon the Kingdom of Monkeys but couldn't retrieve the lost belongings. A swarm of bumblebees hovered at a safe distance. We were asked to speak in hushed tones, lest we attract their attention. Dogs followed us in the hope of getting scraps from the lip-smacking power packs. A giant python slid across the kids' shoulders and necks. A cobra danced for the kids' cameras with its hood open and left the kids to spellbound. A tusker elephant stood patiently on the roadside allowing our bus to pass. A herd of deer gambolled amongst the Polonnaruwa ruins. A most unexpected visitor during dinner was a majestic owl and we went click-click again. 

Meghomala has a way with dogs. They listen to her. Watching her, I realized that until one had loved an animal, a part of the soul remains unawakened. Krishiv video chats with his dog every day. 

But the heroes of the day were Palakh and Jayesh. They sailed through the MasterChef and JAM challenges admirably. For a debut, their corn bhel was so authentic, it would have put Bombay Shiv Sagar to shame. 

After three UNESCO world heritage sites, the body was tired. But we decided to swim with our hearts. Muskan, Manasvi and Yana are ace swimmers, their strokes decisive and fluid. They won every race. 

Phone usage has dropped drastically from an average of 3 1/2 hours to 37 minutes. Perhaps, corporal punishment does reform. But the winner was Samriddh who refused to talk to his mother lest his phone shows a shameful log entry. 

The Superiors won 'Mind-Boggling Lateral Thinking'. But tomorrow is another day. 

I'm sure everyone is dreaming of elephants at the moment. 

Shhhh.....

Punctuality is the courtesy of Kings. Eight girls couldn't keep to the 6-7-8 am time schedule this morning and were punished. They were made to dance for the more punctilious. 

But it takes all kinds to make the world an interesting place. 

We visited the Millennium Elephant Foundation, the Iswarya Ayurvedic Spice Garden and relished an ethnic cultural show at Kandy theatre. Thereafter, we were transported in a shuttle to the magnificent Serendip Stone Bungalow. A swim and a sumptuous dinner were followed by filing away memories for retrieval at a later date and a strategy game of Battleships. 

All in a day's work. 

I'm privileged to be the raconteur of our adventures but nothing I write will do justice to today's experiences. They were incredible. 

Besides, a video is worth a thousand words. 

Be punctual, please. We'll find a way to reprimand you but we cannot recycle the wasted time ever. 

Blessed....

I apologize for missing the deadline last evening. But I was 'spooked' out of my wits and too petrified to string a coherent sentence together. Some children narrated frightening tales around a flickering candle in a wooden attic while other young rascals provided sound effects and special effects. I was completely unnerved. 

Yesterday, we found ourselves improvising all day. How can an adventure be a planned itinerary anyway!? The visit to the Blue Tea Factory went as per plan. The heart of tea is in the plucking and the soul of tea is in the steeping. The children learnt all this and more. 

Thereafter, an unplanned, strenuous hike led us to the Ramboda waterfall. We took a bath in it, at least the more daring ones did while the others watched and grappled with their diffidence and fears. I must mention Aanya here. She is doing something every day that hitherto scared her. A mind stretched by new experiences cannot return to its old dimensions. Aanya is a wondrous wonder everyday! Some complained of the moss, others of the rocks hurting their feet. But the waterfall wouldn't sound as melodious if there weren't rocks in its bed. All in all, everyone was delighted and went without a change handy! 

Cycling at Nuwara Eliya was a spur of the moment decision too. The lake was shimmering. The Tudor style cottages were billowing smoke from their chimneys. The twilight was casting long shadows on the turf. The setting sun was outlining the clouds with silver linings. We chose to cycle a 5 km circuit and savour it all. One just can't be sad while riding a bike. All the riders returned grinning from ear to ear. 

In the meantime, the chefs of the day - Bhanvi, Meghomala and Vanshika made assorted sandwiches that looked lavish and tasted sumptuous. What culinary connoisseurs!!! They were completely sold out and the kids were begging for more. 

We can proceed according to a planned itinerary strenuously trying to make life conform to its needs or we can adapt to whatever we meet and flow without effort. 

We chose the latter. 

Yesterday we heard the waterfall and birds and winds sing. 

Today the song of the waves is lulling us to sleep.

5/3/19, 5:34 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I have to face the backlash
5/3/19, 5:34 PM - Jenit Jain: As Ive said, you didn't handle it for a long time so I did. Now you have to deal with the consequences of
5/3/19, 5:34 PM - Jenit Jain: It
5/3/19, 5:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's not your job to correct me
5/3/19, 5:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I handled it my way and it was absolutely fine
5/3/19, 5:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Not affecting you or me
5/3/19, 5:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Who tf am I supposed to talk to in class.
5/3/19, 5:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Selfish
5/3/19, 5:38 PM - Jenit Jain: I've told you it was affecting me
5/3/19, 5:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: How
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's no point talking to you man
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You don't understand anything
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita after somiya even I had to make friends in class. Divya has been in my class since sem 1 and I still started talking to her in this semester
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That was your fault
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You liked her
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And went on dates and all
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Jenit Jain: So yes you should have friends is my point
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: While we were dating
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Fuck you
5/3/19, 5:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Fo you too much
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Jenit Jain: I asked you for jogs
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Did you not
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Jenit Jain: every time
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Jenit Jain: NO
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Fuck you now
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Bye
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cycling trips in the morning?
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe Siddharth was right
5/3/19, 5:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I should've given you more bt about that
5/3/19, 5:50 PM - Jenit Jain: Do you still want to give me bt? You didn't give me bt thank you. But I didn't take it lightly either, I didn't make any contact. Over here, you know how affected I got by him and for so long you let it go on and didnt care for my feelings. And now you're bringing it up again which says you clearly still care which hurts me more.
5/3/19, 5:50 PM - Jenit Jain: So sorry if you think you're going to talk to him again. Because that's not happening
5/3/19, 5:53 PM - Jenit Jain: ?
5/3/19, 5:56 PM - Jenit Jain: What
5/3/19, 5:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre but you liked her and she liked you back na. Even then I knew that our relationship was more important than a stupid crush. Why can't you see that now? Don't you understand? I don't make friends that easily and now that I did you just went and removed them from my life which btw you had no authority to do. You didn't get affected at all. Acha and while we're on that topic how many times have I told you to not smoke did you listen even once. It's been bothering me also. It's not like I took the pot and flushed it down a toilet. I'm bringing it up again because I care obviously. It shouldn't hurt you it should show that I really need you to be okay with it. Jen honestly it's not even your place to say anything and if it was someone else they would've spoken also by now. I don't know when what happened that now I have to ask your permission to do anything. And this anything isn't even wrong. Acha leave me, let's talk about what you're saying. Affecting you this that bullshit it was affecting you. You know what's happening is that it's affecting you now. 6 months is a long time Jen. 
I can't be content with my life I can't keep you happy cause of my thoughts . No one is happy with what you did
5/3/19, 5:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Are you really saying that we as a couple are in a better place now than January? And if you are then I'm sorry but you and I are in two very different places.
5/3/19, 5:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Who are 'them' I took from your life man. Start naming.
5/3/19, 5:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Dude all of them
5/3/19, 5:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Is it because you have a problem with me making guy friends ?
5/3/19, 5:59 PM - Jenit Jain: All relationships have ups and downs. I have been distant this sem because of the marriage and then this fracture
5/3/19, 6:00 PM - Jenit Jain: I had to focus on other too
5/3/19, 6:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Name no
5/3/19, 6:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Other things*
5/3/19, 6:01 PM - Jenit Jain: If they are decent or at least keep you safe, what problem will I have
5/3/19, 6:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You have to focus on everything else did you even once think about me ? I told you longggggg back I won't move out. Who am I supposed to chill with when you're busy. What do you want me to be at your beck and call at all times that toh anyway I am na jen. What do you want from me I toh still can't understand
5/3/19, 6:02 PM - Dikshita Kothari: They kept me happy and I felt good to chill with people who didn't judge
5/3/19, 6:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: All the people I called for my bday dinner to meet Mom minus the girls and Kshitij Shashank Sanidhya
5/3/19, 6:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Dude if they left because you stopped talking to 1 guy, then it's not my fault that they didn't think of you as important enough. Why do you want them to be so important if they don't give a shit about you
5/3/19, 6:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause it's bro code and you know it don't give me stupid reasons
5/3/19, 6:03 PM - Jenit Jain: And who are those people you name man.
5/3/19, 6:03 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Akshat Pranjal Rudraksh Jayant Rishabh
5/3/19, 6:04 PM - Jenit Jain: Umm not really. If everyone is friends it's not a problem. Bro code comes if you're an ex you stupid girl
5/3/19, 6:04 PM - Jenit Jain: 4 people who at least thought you weren't important enough, not my fault
5/3/19, 6:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why would they talk to me after you insulted their best friend
5/3/19, 6:04 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Do you think I'm important enough for you ?
5/3/19, 6:04 PM - Jenit Jain: And they saw how I cordial was with them so yeah this
5/3/19, 6:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes baby
5/3/19, 6:05 PM - Jenit Jain: One of the most
5/3/19, 6:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: One of the more *
5/3/19, 6:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Doesn't make sense
5/3/19, 6:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's proper English
5/3/19, 6:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Most is only one
5/3/19, 6:05 PM - Dikshita Kothari: One of the most doesn't make sense
5/3/19, 6:06 PM - Jenit Jain: One of the more important people ever???
5/3/19, 6:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Or
5/3/19, 6:06 PM - Jenit Jain: One of the most important people ever
5/3/19, 6:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: .
5/3/19, 6:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So then try to understand what I'm going through and give in
5/3/19, 6:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I promise I will not mention them to you again
5/3/19, 6:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why are you so insecure
5/3/19, 6:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine you got more in verbal
5/3/19, 6:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Just relax na
5/3/19, 6:07 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm relax
5/3/19, 6:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Be good to people Jen otherwise it's going to hit you so hard in the back you won't know what happened
5/3/19, 6:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't ever be happy after making someone sad
5/3/19, 6:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It happened with Nethraa also I felt guilty for some 2 months and now it's happening again
5/3/19, 6:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't deal with it and I don't like it
5/3/19, 6:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And you shouldn't try to change me to fit your needs
5/3/19, 6:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't keep saying thag
5/3/19, 6:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're doing it
5/3/19, 6:09 PM - Jenit Jain: I haven't done anything so sevre to fuck you up
5/3/19, 6:10 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'll be myself if I do what I want can you deal with that then
5/3/19, 6:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Also ask nethraa how she became a family member at pragati
5/3/19, 6:10 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't I feel shy
5/3/19, 6:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Lol
5/3/19, 6:10 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Do you have a problem with that also ?
5/3/19, 6:12 PM - Jenit Jain: I feel very sad when you ask me if you can go chill with class people also. I've told you that you have to update me that you're going somewhere not ask for permission
5/3/19, 6:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Matlab tumko stay over karna hai ya nahi
5/3/19, 6:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'll sneak in from the back
5/3/19, 6:13 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Jen update
5/3/19, 6:13 PM - Jenit Jain: You can't fit through the garage gate because you're too busy hehe
5/3/19, 6:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Good
5/3/19, 6:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm going to apologise for my behaviour because I think I was very wrong to hurt someone so much. And then if possible I will try to make friends again. Please be okay with it. It's just one semester. Please jen.
5/3/19, 6:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Like I did with Nethraa
5/3/19, 6:14 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't apologise and please make friends
5/3/19, 6:14 PM - Jenit Jain: But new ones
5/3/19, 6:14 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I don't want new friends mannnn
5/3/19, 6:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Pranjal ke alava baat karona sabse
5/3/19, 6:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have so much strength to lose so many people
5/3/19, 6:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Didn't you say you won't even talk to these people
5/3/19, 6:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Nahi kar raha koi mujhse baat pehle jaise Jen.
5/3/19, 6:15 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Kya ?
5/3/19, 6:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Sad luck
5/3/19, 6:16 PM - Jenit Jain: To your class people after manipal
5/3/19, 6:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I had so many friends for the first time in my life and you selfish person legit removed everyone with one swipe. My mom was so happy when she came she said wah finally you made new friends. First year ka group ka 4 people are left. But that okay I understand there were reasons yahan koi reason nahi hai babu pls. And haan I probably won't talk to anyone after Manipal is over but at least let me enjoy it while it is. Koi itna nahi poochta Jen. I'm asking cause it's important for me to feel good about myself again. I can't go through summer vacation knowing that there are so many things I can save.
5/3/19, 6:19 PM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita this is too much begging
5/3/19, 6:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why is it so difficult for you to give me what I want? First of all I don't even know why your permission is needed but I'm asking then also.
5/3/19, 6:19 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't like it
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're making me beg
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Wah thanks mam
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't say anything rude in this
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's all fact
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't even know what to say
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Why are you falling to such a level
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't say I'm forcing and shit
5/3/19, 6:20 PM - Jenit Jain: That's bs
5/3/19, 6:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you it'll be better for both of us also if I have others to chill with.
5/3/19, 6:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No it's really not
5/3/19, 6:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Why can't you past fight be. Everytime I tell you to clear after a fight you say yeah everything's fine or you yourself say that let's not talk about it, fuck it. And then you bring allll the shit again
5/3/19, 6:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's actually become impossible for me to do anything I want. Simply all the time I'm thinking that if jenit gets too angry he's again going to break his hand
5/3/19, 6:22 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm not
5/3/19, 6:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Because I'm trying to let go but I can't
5/3/19, 6:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If not yours someone else's
5/3/19, 6:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Try harder. You're an adult. Learn. That's how you always Learn. Good
5/3/19, 6:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Might
5/3/19, 6:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's the thing I don't want to learn all these bad things
5/3/19, 6:24 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
5/3/19, 6:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why can't you understand I think it's going to be better for both of us as well. I told you na we're not in the same place as we used to be in the beginning of the semester. Try to understand what I'm saying and let me fix it my way
5/3/19, 6:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're acting like a male chauvinist pig Jen
5/3/19, 6:24 PM - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
5/3/19, 6:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're legit saying if you talk to him I will break his hand
5/3/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Fuck it I take it back
5/3/19, 6:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Do what you want is good
5/3/19, 6:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's the last thing I read

5/4/19, 12:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Something and all I said I don't even remember
5/4/19, 12:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I've been sitting awhile on this window seat with it smooth polished wooden top, close to the window. The pot plants have been quivering plenty but holding their perch. The trees beyond have been swaying dangerously but holding their own too. Wood is resilient, priceless in it's ageing and forever young, capable of being born a hundred times. Tiny rivulets have formed on the window panes distorting my view of the world. I have left the window a little ajar to feel the cold spray on my cheek and hand whenever the wind wills it. Storm or no storm, the city's rites of dawn must be underway. Newspaper boys must wheel past and toss their rolls. Milkmen, on cycles, their large tin cans clanging, must ring door bells. The brisk, bowlegged, old men and women who work their arms as if dragging back their youth must be up and wonder what to do. On a clear day, boy servants take out the dogs of their masters. The dogs must be restlessly scraping at their front doors. 
The peril is almost passed. Man will bury and leave behind loss, sorrow, failure, misery and deprivation. If the man didn't know this routine, he'd be so roasted and weighted, he couldn't move a single step. 
So let's talk of oases with springs of sherbet and doe-eyed houris...
It's a survival tool. It's a life skill.

And you're bringing it up so lightly. Thanks Jen I appreciate it. And no that's not what you get from your girlfriend. I will not be ordered around and I don't need your permission to do things. I'm so tired of this bs
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Jenit Jain: Even I'm tired. So how about you stick to your free will and I'll stick to the toxicity? Atleast it works for you
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Jenit Jain: So it shouldn't a problem
5/6/19, 12:19 AM - Jenit Jain: At least you'll start feeling like January again
5/6/19, 12:20 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to make any sacrifices for me and I don't want to make any for you either
5/6/19, 12:20 AM - Jenit Jain: Okay then

5/6/19, 12:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Cool
5/6/19, 12:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Anything more you want to blame me for?

5/6/19, 12:27 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Why don't you understand
5/6/19, 12:27 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I wasn't brought up like that
5/6/19, 12:28 AM - Jenit Jain: Not brought up to have self respect?
5/6/19, 12:28 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Not brought up to leave things in such a bad place for three months
5/6/19, 12:28 AM - Jenit Jain: Who are you to decide if they are in a bad place.
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Jenit Jain: Clearly it's affecting only you
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm in a bad place
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Exactly
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Jenit Jain: Which makes only you stupid
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I know what to do to make myself feel better
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You had your way the entire semester
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's my turn now
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Jenit Jain: Oh shut up
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And that's final
5/6/19, 12:29 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You shut up

5/6/19, 12:30 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Just let me know Jen
5/6/19, 12:31 AM - Jenit Jain: You leave it be dikshita. You fucked up initially by not talking my advice and keeping your friendship under control. I told you billion times to stop it. You always said you would handle it. Instead you didn't do jackshiy. And if I'm right, you loved the idea of people having a crush on you. Then when that back fired you started blaming me for everything
5/6/19, 12:31 AM - Jenit Jain: You tell me first why didn't you do anything to stop it for 1.5 years
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I told him I didn't like him
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Jenit Jain: Even your mom says you could have been more stern
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And that's it
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Dikshita Kothari: The rest is not my business
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Jenit Jain: So now face the consequences
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Jenit Jain: Great
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No I will not
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You can't give me consequences
5/6/19, 12:32 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't done anything wrong and I know it
5/6/19, 12:33 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You're the one who's too insecure to see your mistake
5/6/19, 12:33 AM - Jenit Jain: Tumhara accha hai. When is time for you to enjoy all this bs then you'll have time if your life. When it comes to bite you, it was never your fault? Wahhh
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Neither insecure nor mistaken
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Dikshita Kothari: What came to bite me? From where I'm standing it was you Jen
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm not taking the blame for anything
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Jenit Jain: The facts dikshita the facts
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You have caused me so much pain this semester k I will never forget it
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Dikshita Kothari: What do I do with your facts
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Me too
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You're the one who hurt me
5/6/19, 12:34 AM - Jenit Jain: Shove it up
5/6/19, 12:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If this is the way you talk to your gf
5/6/19, 12:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Sure I was toh having the time of my life
5/6/19, 12:35 AM - Jenit Jain: Then what
5/6/19, 12:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Just drama for no reason
5/6/19, 12:35 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I was so happy
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Is*
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Jenit Jain: You really should have handled it in the 3-4th semester
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Jenit Jain: You don't crib now
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You just shut up
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You cannot interfere
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's not your place
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Jenit Jain: I didn't for the longest time
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Jenit Jain: Be grateful
5/6/19, 12:36 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And even now it's not your place Jen
5/6/19, 12:37 AM - Jenit Jain: And when it affected me by annoying me beyond a threshold, then yeah it is my problem
5/6/19, 12:37 AM - Jenit Jain: And I solved it
5/6/19, 12:37 AM - Dikshita Kothari: This message was deleted
5/6/19, 12:37 AM - Jenit Jain: You give me one good reason of not handling long ago
5/6/19, 12:38 AM - Jenit Jain: It's neither of our faults that he didn't stop liking you. But I'm very sure if you had made any effort he would have stopped.
5/6/19, 12:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Moreover, you didn't want him yo stop liking you. You like fans I know
5/6/19, 12:38 AM - Jenit Jain: So stfu
5/6/19, 12:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Stop putting this shit on me
5/6/19, 12:39 AM - Jenit Jain: Your unhappiness is your long time coming undoing
5/6/19, 12:42 AM - Jenit Jain: Could you type any slowet
5/6/19, 12:45 AM - Dikshita Kothari: My handling is different from your handling. 
It was just annoying you but your stupidity this semester has made me so angry and so sad that I don't even recognise myself anymore. Do you remember what I was in first semester. That's who you liked and that's who I want to be. You're just not letting me be that person. When some situations are delicate handling is just giving the person some time to get over it. When he got a no from my side he never bothered me about it again. I never even heard or thought that he still liked me. He was doing absolutely nothing except helping me adjust in class. And you went and told him that he was harassing me. You keep saying I embarrassed you jenit. Do you know how much you've embarrassed me? That too in front of my class people. Now I'm just that girl who's life is handled by her bf. You made my life difficult in my place of work/study and that's just not acceptable to me. If you can't not interfere in my work life then you should just not hear about it cause I won't tell you anything. My head must be bonkers to feel so guilty all the time. I should've known that if people don't understand some things, those things just shouldn't be shared with them.
5/6/19, 12:47 AM - Jenit Jain: Wow
5/6/19, 12:47 AM - Jenit Jain: What about the million gifts
5/6/19, 12:47 AM - Jenit Jain: Do you think that's okay for me!
5/6/19, 12:47 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Last semester even for your friends I was dikshita and now I'm just another girl right... I just don't fit the bill anymore. I'm trying to get myself back to that. If you can't support me then idk what you're doing.
5/6/19, 12:47 AM - Jenit Jain: Fine I don't share
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: What million gifts ???
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: Teddy's chocolates and bs
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: Who the fuck gives a teddy
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: Fuck you
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: They toh consider you as part of their group
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Teddy was fourth Sem
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Chocolates was for my bday
5/6/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: Vidit got supplies for you from Dubai but nevermind
5/6/19, 12:49 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm telling you since before that only please let it be
5/6/19, 12:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so sorry I don't feel like I deserve it anymore
5/6/19, 12:49 AM - Jenit Jain: Good burn it
5/6/19, 12:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: The supplies?
5/6/19, 12:50 AM - Jenit Jain: He got chocolates and all for you separately
5/6/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: That's very sweet
5/6/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't deserve it
5/6/19, 12:50 AM - Jenit Jain: Okay
5/6/19, 12:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't deserve any of it
5/6/19, 12:50 AM - Jenit Jain: No one will get
5/6/19, 12:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Jen see the thing is
5/6/19, 12:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If I can't get myself together I don't ever be able to fix our relationship
5/6/19, 12:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I know what I need to do to get my shit together
5/6/19, 12:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If you can, please support
5/6/19, 12:52 AM - Jenit Jain: Every time one thing only you have to sah
5/6/19, 12:52 AM - Jenit Jain: This is how you blackmail
5/6/19, 12:52 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Let me get all situations back to how they were last sem
5/6/19, 12:52 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I did so well I never thought I'd get a 9.5 + Jen but I did
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I was doing well
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Why won't you let me get back to that
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm sorry for fucking it all up dikshita
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not blackmailing you
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Jenit Jain: And why are we even arguing
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you the truth
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Jenit Jain: I've already told you do what you want man
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you what I feel
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even want to hear
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Jenit Jain: I've heard it before
5/6/19, 12:53 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But you just don't care it is
5/6/19, 12:54 AM - Jenit Jain: For your class "friends", no I don't
5/6/19, 12:54 AM - Jenit Jain: Do what you want
5/6/19, 12:54 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm sleeping
5/6/19, 12:54 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes I will
5/6/19, 12:54 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Good night
5/6/19, 12:54 AM - Jenit Jain: I can't be bothered with this shit anymore
5/6/19, 12:54 AM - Jenit Jain: Gn
5/6/19, 12:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I wish you would've never been bothered by it cause it was none of your business
5/6/19, 12:55 AM - Jenit Jain: Until you let it GET OUT OF PROPORTION AND IT STARTED TO AFFECT ME
5/6/19, 12:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It was same as last sem and the sem before
5/6/19, 12:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Im sorry your friends don't think you're important enough. Just don't blame me because I'm not taking shit :)
5/6/19, 12:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Piling up
5/6/19, 12:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: My friends have no relation to you
5/6/19, 12:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Look at how you're cornering me
5/6/19, 12:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Think of yourself in my situation
5/6/19, 12:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You selfish boy
5/6/19, 12:57 AM - Jenit Jain: You still haven't even said why you didn't make sure it stopped. But like you said, you just told him you didn't like him. Should be enough. Then again your mother said the same thing that you should have made it clear to him. But eh who am I to judge. Especially considering the fact that he himself said you never said no to him so he continued liking.
5/6/19, 12:57 AM - Jenit Jain: Maybe it's all your fault that you got too happy of having followers
5/6/19, 12:58 AM - Jenit Jain: I wouldnt get in your situation because I have my priorities clear
5/6/19, 12:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya right. At least think before you type nonsense
5/6/19, 12:59 AM - Jenit Jain: You've said something along those lines
5/6/19, 12:59 AM - Jenit Jain: Weren't you just too happy that so many people had a crush on you
5/6/19, 12:59 AM - Jenit Jain: I think you were
5/6/19, 1:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I wasn't
5/6/19, 1:00 AM - Jenit Jain: Sure
5/6/19, 1:00 AM - Jenit Jain: Liar
5/6/19, 1:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Plural never any single person
5/6/19, 1:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I enjoyed compliments I don't understand why I'm supposed to apologise for this
5/6/19, 1:01 AM - Jenit Jain: I haven't asked you to apologise for anything
5/6/19, 1:01 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm just saying I'm glad you enjoyed, now suffer the down side
5/6/19, 1:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You are no one to tell me what I will and what I will not suffer. If I did anything wrong I'll know it in the future. You don't have to take it upon yourself to tell me to suffer. What kind of a person are you? Why do you want to suffer? You don't like seeing me happy is it.
5/6/19, 1:03 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm not making you suffer
5/6/19, 1:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes you are
5/6/19, 1:04 AM - Jenit Jain: Your actions have led to all this BS. Pranjal himself said that you didn't say no to him. What other proof you need. It's not my fault your crushes went out if the way which then included your bf
5/6/19, 1:04 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I said no
5/6/19, 1:04 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I used to roam around with you the entire time
5/6/19, 1:04 AM - Jenit Jain: Great, next time try louder
5/6/19, 1:04 AM - Dikshita Kothari: He's not blind
5/6/19, 1:04 AM - Jenit Jain: Yet he didn't stop
5/6/19, 1:05 AM - Dikshita Kothari: He stopped
5/6/19, 1:05 AM - Dikshita Kothari: What did he do ?
5/6/19, 1:05 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Nothing !!!
5/6/19, 1:05 AM - Jenit Jain: He didn't jeez
5/6/19, 1:05 AM - Dikshita Kothari: He did
5/6/19, 1:05 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Are you dumb
5/6/19, 1:05 AM - Jenit Jain: Omg can you just stick to the facts your stupid girl
5/6/19, 1:06 AM - Jenit Jain: He confessed to me
5/6/19, 1:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Fuck it
5/6/19, 1:06 AM - Jenit Jain: You're not even making sense
5/6/19, 1:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Do what you want
5/6/19, 1:06 AM - Jenit Jain: And you'll accordingly find a place to stay
5/6/19, 1:06 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Because you would've beaten him up if he didn't
5/6/19, 1:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Or maybe he was too scared to lie because he is and even looks like a pussy
5/6/19, 1:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Who are you calling a pussy Jen you were the one who took kaustubh along with you to beat him up
5/6/19, 1:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't even have the balls to go alone
5/6/19, 1:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Hahahahahaha you think I can't beat him up alone. Kaustubh was there to stop be and not to beat him up
5/6/19, 1:08 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If he would've come alone matlab toh def he would've gone back in two pieces
5/6/19, 1:08 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't give me that bs
5/6/19, 1:08 AM - Dikshita Kothari: What you did was wrong
5/6/19, 1:08 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't approve of it
5/6/19, 1:08 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't forget it
5/6/19, 1:08 AM - Jenit Jain: And all this talk is supposed to make me more comfortable about your reconciliation with him
5/6/19, 1:09 AM - Jenit Jain: Lol doubt it
5/6/19, 1:09 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And I can't believe you would do that to someone who has helped your gf so much
5/6/19, 1:09 AM - Jenit Jain: You think rishab and jayant could have stopped me
5/6/19, 1:09 AM - Jenit Jain: Hahahha
5/6/19, 1:09 AM - Jenit Jain: Cute
5/6/19, 1:09 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so grateful to him

5/6/19, 1:09 AM - Jenit Jain: .
5/6/19, 1:10 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's supposed to help me help you understand why you were wrong
5/6/19, 1:10 AM - Jenit Jain: First toh I'm not getting convinced that I was wrong
5/6/19, 1:10 AM - Jenit Jain: I most definitely wasn't
5/6/19, 1:11 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So leave it
5/6/19, 1:11 AM - Dikshita Kothari: We're at an impasse
5/6/19, 1:11 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You have an exam tomorrow

5/6/19, 8:37 AM - Jenit Jain: Well if I had a girlfriend who actually listened to me when things were fine then it wouldn't have messed up. Your mother was right. Your fault you didn't tell pranjal sternlyn

5/6/19, 8:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I failed to act so you think that you have the right to punish me
5/6/19, 8:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Fine so are you breaking up?
5/6/19, 8:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't be delusional
5/6/19, 8:38 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm not punishing you
5/6/19, 8:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes you are
5/6/19, 8:38 AM - Jenit Jain: I just got rid of the problem my way
5/6/19, 8:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Your way sucks and I know it's going to happen again and again and I can't deal with it

5/6/19, 8:40 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to interfere in my friendships again or even now
5/6/19, 8:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If I want to fix it I will you shouldn't even want to stop me
5/6/19, 8:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Jen please concentrate on your paper
5/6/19, 8:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: The hotstar password changed
5/6/19, 8:41 AM - Jenit Jain: If they mess with your bf, bf will interfere. If you don't want me to interfere and still do everything according to your way ( which is practically not doing anything about the problem ) then break up now and spare both of us the time.
5/6/19, 8:42 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If you think I'm the one who's going to call it off you're crazy
5/6/19, 8:42 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I know better than to let you go
5/6/19, 8:42 AM - Jenit Jain: So basically you'll do whatever the fuck you want and then you expect me to be like no this isnt too much?

5/6/19, 8:44 AM - Jenit Jain: What am I supposed to say to that tepl
5/6/19, 8:44 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If you wanna give gaali we're done talking

5/6/19, 8:46 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry but my self esteem is higher than this. I'm tired of being embarassed in class. I can't even look people in the eye anymore. I'm sorry I'm not okay with the situation and now I will do what I have to to remedy it.
5/6/19, 8:46 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Are you mad

5/20/19, 4:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What abt this ?
5/20/19, 4:49 PM - Jenit Jain: It's nice but not fancy
5/20/19, 4:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Video call when free bby
5/20/19, 5:27 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
5/20/19, 6:22 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha okay you're busy
5/20/19, 6:22 PM - Jenit Jain: So updating
5/20/19, 6:22 PM - Jenit Jain: I got internship, through ankurs contacts, with ankur.
5/20/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: The internship that j really wanted, I'm not pursuing that.
Because 
a) I will really have to dedicate time to it so I won't be able to practice for the placements which is priority.
b) too fucking far so wasting too much time during such a critical vacation.
c) the internship I'm doing is basically a scam. Like they are a proper corporate company but since it's through reference, they don't really expect us to do much, I don't have to go there, and their problem statement for us is very similar to my previous internship so I'll easily do it. Plus I'll have time for small projects and placement prep
5/20/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't think I'll regret this decision
5/20/19, 6:26 PM - Jenit Jain: And finally I can get vacation routine since I know what's happening.
5/20/19, 6:26 PM - Jenit Jain: I want you to support my decision
5/20/19, 6:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
5/20/19, 6:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Do
5/20/19, 6:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What's the problem
5/20/19, 6:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What's placement prep ?
5/20/19, 6:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Competitive coding data structures and interview questions
5/20/19, 6:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Acha
5/20/19, 6:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And you have to allocate separate time for this ?
5/20/19, 6:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes everyday thing. This is main. Then internship. Then the chotu projects
5/20/19, 6:40 PM - Jenit Jain: According to me
5/20/19, 6:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Because if I don't get a good job, then whatever I've done till date from school doesn't really count
5/20/19, 7:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Jen
5/20/19, 7:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If you're confident it's the right decision then go for it !

5/21/19, 5:13 PM - Jenit Jain: You need to tell your mom that it's your vacation too
5/21/19, 5:13 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Idk what moms problem is

5/21/19, 5:16 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What other time do I have to spend with them
5/21/19, 5:18 PM - Jenit Jain: You do realize that's it's just our age. We have a million things to worry about since we are going to be introduced to the proper world very soon. And parents can barely solve very few. Rest we are on our own. So it's fine dikshita.
5/21/19, 5:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Dude my parents can solve everything
5/21/19, 5:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No thanks I don't wanna be on my own
5/21/19, 5:19 PM - Jenit Jain: You need to explain your mother all this instead of just blindly listening to them because when we were kids, they knew what should we do. But now that we're big, they can't really relate because their 20s were wayyyyy diff
5/21/19, 5:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm fine with them making my decisions

6/14/19, 11:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Who has been there for a year
6/14/19, 11:18 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And has a questionable reputation himself
6/14/19, 11:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Last sem you told me you trust Priyanka
6/14/19, 11:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Now you're telling me you're kicking her out
6/14/19, 11:19 PM - Jenit Jain: you really dont take all this stuff seriously no. you just want friends no matter the quality. bade hogaye ho. if you cant stand up for whats right no matter the consequences and the hard decisions you have to make then manipal mai 4 saal what did you even learn. Dikshita friendship mai loyalty and trust is the most important, if shes willing to sell her trust by lying about someone to gain some attention doesnt mean that she continues to deserve my or someone elses friendship. no matter how much ever fun youve had
6/14/19, 11:19 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Wtf
6/14/19, 11:20 PM - Jenit Jain: so please dont say that 3 years you had fun then you kick them out. i did the same thing with nethraa eventhough she hadnt done shit to me directly.
6/14/19, 11:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Did you talk to her even once
6/14/19, 11:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: To Priyanka
6/14/19, 11:20 PM - Jenit Jain: At that time i stood up for you and gave up that friendship. you dont see me cribbing over thoe decisions
6/14/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya and I regret not stopping your ass everyday
6/14/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Stood up for me?
6/14/19, 11:21 PM - Jenit Jain: evidently i was wrong and im agreeing
6/14/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you specifically don't tell her anything
6/14/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's not how you treat people
6/14/19, 11:21 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Damn Jen
6/14/19, 11:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Imagine this happening to you
6/14/19, 11:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: How would you cope
6/14/19, 11:22 PM - Dikshita Kothari: With no chance to explain yourself
6/14/19, 11:22 PM - Jenit Jain: i mean if you dont have the balls to defend yourself and keep some self respect then someone has to. so i did
6/14/19, 11:23 PM - Jenit Jain: chance to explain what man. she'll shy away from embarrassment and then get awwkward. i know all this will only happen
6/14/19, 11:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That wasn't your job you really need to learn to not interfere in other people's matters
6/14/19, 11:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Antaryaami ho tum
6/14/19, 11:23 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Baat nahi kiya usse uske pehle how can you assume
6/14/19, 11:23 PM - Jenit Jain: I will definitely remember to not stand up for you, no matter the concequences, if you dont stand up for yourseld
6/14/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya please don't
6/14/19, 11:24 PM - Jenit Jain: im not assuming anything.
6/14/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No one asked you
6/14/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Talk to her directly
6/14/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why can't you talk to a friend man
6/14/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: She meant nothing for you that means
6/14/19, 11:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You were just looking for an excuse
6/14/19, 11:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Even with Nethraa some lame excuse you found with that apratim scenario
6/14/19, 11:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Just TALK TO HER DIRECTLY
6/14/19, 11:25 PM - Jenit Jain: because when arav fucks up he confesses immediately. he had allegations with another girl whom vidit dated last sem. when vidit got to the bottom of it, the girl couldnt say shit against arav because he was innocent. Other times he fucked up, he will say it and ask for further advice on how to unfuck it so i atleast can believe that
6/14/19, 11:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Im sorry that i stopped talking to a GOOD friend because she was making your life a living hell.
6/14/19, 11:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Arre so he's making the same mistake 600 times doesn't make it a mistake anymore that's a habit now
6/14/19, 11:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Finally you got it right
6/14/19, 11:27 PM - Jenit Jain: you just wont understand some decisions because your levelof maturity doesnt allow you to comprehend such complex scenarios. im sorry the world isnt as simple as you want it to be
6/14/19, 11:27 PM - Jenit Jain: his mistake is being alleged for shit he didnt do?
6/14/19, 11:27 PM - Dikshita Kothari: How about I talk to you once my level of maturity matches yours at least that way we won't keep fighting about everything
6/14/19, 11:28 PM - Jenit Jain: this is a discussion that goes on in all relationships. atleast we arent fighting about something between us so thats good
6/14/19, 11:29 PM - Jenit Jain: discussions are how you learn new things
6/14/19, 11:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're saying this after calling me immature
6/14/19, 11:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not like you Jen
6/14/19, 11:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't see things the way you do
6/14/19, 11:29 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And I don't like the way you see things
6/14/19, 11:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't believe you're able to let go of an old friendship because of something stupid she said/did
6/14/19, 11:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Atleast 50 times
6/14/19, 11:30 PM - Jenit Jain: hoping you learn something
6/14/19, 11:30 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like your bullshit ideals
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not the one who needs to learn here Jen
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: well i'll be next you when the your fantasy world bubble breaks so its fine
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I know what I know is right
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: time and again
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not going to change my thought process
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: .
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Are you waiting with a pin to pop it
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I know how the world works
6/14/19, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: i cant pop it. only life will pop it

6/14/19, 11:41 PM - Jenit Jain: aww when a boy you liked, liked someone else and not you?
6/14/19, 11:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Are you sure you wanna put it like that ?
6/14/19, 11:44 PM - Jenit Jain: dikshita even i had girl troubles that put me in depression and made me go to a shrink and what not
6/14/19, 11:44 PM - Jenit Jain: and i still dont think thats when my bubble popped
6/14/19, 11:44 PM - Jenit Jain: so yes i dont think that is when you bubble popped
6/14/19, 11:44 PM - Jenit Jain: i dont think it still has so well
6/14/19, 11:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Then it never will Jen
6/14/19, 11:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Are you expecting me to change or something
6/14/19, 11:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't understand
6/14/19, 11:46 PM - Jenit Jain: and even if it does i'll be on your side. how bad can it be then right
6/14/19, 11:47 PM - Jenit Jain: no i want you to realise how fucked up life can be and how your rules dont make sense in real life. and the sooner it happens the better else ^
6/14/19, 11:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not going to grow up 
I'm not going to mature more 
No bubble exists to be popped
The stuff I've heard will send shivers down your spine 
No I will not share them with you 
Everyone deserves to be happy including me 
I will not be the reason for anyone's sadness 
Get this in your head Jen
I am not changing 
And stop trying to make me change 
I like being happy 
And I like being who I am 
It makes me proud of myself to think that I'm not one of the depressed souls in the world and I am the reason for anyone's happiness 
I know how fucked up life can be 
My rules are what I will stick by till the end 
Get in with it or just keep your mouth shut 
Because everything you say goes right against everything I would say 
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN 
STOP TRYING TO CHANGE ME
JUST. STOP. IT. 
I am very mature 
And I know what is right and what is wrong 
I will stick by that

6/15/19, 12:07 AM - Jenit Jain: I am just trying to keep you entertained during the vacation with random stuff. because if i depend on you to talk, you toh wont since you have million other things to do in the vacation that you barely have time to talk. and its fine that you're busy. I'm glad you have stuff to do but when someone is trying to talk then either directly say i dont want to hear gossip rather than calling their opinions bs
6/15/19, 12:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Fine I'll do that then
6/15/19, 12:08 AM - Jenit Jain: and i'll keep my opinions to myseld

6/15/19, 4:31 PM - Jenit Jain: About what I don't understand because I wasn't even trying to change you
6/15/19, 4:31 PM - Jenit Jain: If me talking about people you don't know pisses you off then lesson learned
6/15/19, 4:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You've been calling me immature
6/15/19, 4:31 PM - Dikshita Kothari: For an entire sem now
6/15/19, 4:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's really irritating
6/15/19, 4:32 PM - Jenit Jain: Well opinions differ.
6/15/19, 4:32 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya so that's why I said
6/15/19, 4:33 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Keep your opinions to yourself
6/15/19, 4:33 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause they're shit
6/15/19, 4:33 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm just pointing out what I notice. If you disagree then that's that. Neither of us has to do anything about it
6/15/19, 4:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
6/15/19, 4:33 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No you can't just say stuff like that all the time
6/15/19, 4:33 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And expect me to just not do anything about it
6/15/19, 4:34 PM - Jenit Jain: Atleast I give you an elaborate reason Everytime I call your actions immature. On the other hand you just insult and be rude and never give any justifications so well
6/15/19, 4:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need this drama dude
6/15/19, 4:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If you can accept that I'm immature then good for you
6/15/19, 4:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like your attitude
6/15/19, 4:35 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Or the way you think
6/15/19, 4:36 PM - Jenit Jain: See again no justification to prove this
6/15/19, 4:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Or this
6/15/19, 4:36 PM - Jenit Jain: Like I don't even know what you're talking about
6/15/19, 4:36 PM - Jenit Jain: I have accepted already
6/15/19, 4:36 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I just don't like it
6/15/19, 4:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Regarding what
6/15/19, 4:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Then stop repeating the same thing 500 times and pissing me off
6/15/19, 4:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What's the point I'm the one who has to accept it
6/15/19, 4:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're not going to change right
6/15/19, 4:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Can't even ask you to
6/15/19, 4:39 PM - Jenit Jain: See I'm not like you
6/15/19, 4:40 PM - Jenit Jain: If I see an opportunity for you to learn I'll point it out, learning not learning is your call
6/15/19, 4:40 PM - Jenit Jain: If you show me that I was actually wrong about something. Like my thoughts or actions were very wrong then obviously I'll try to improve on thay
6/15/19, 4:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No you will not cause you don't know the right thing yourself
6/15/19, 4:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You think I'm wrong
6/15/19, 4:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I think you're wrong
6/15/19, 4:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Although this takes effort which clearly you don't care to take so no point talking about it
6/15/19, 4:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Read last night's chat
6/15/19, 4:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Again and again I can't say the same things
6/15/19, 4:42 PM - Jenit Jain: When did I say that I'm going to ghost Priyanka or ignore her or do anything to ruin the friendship Ive had with her you tell me
6/15/19, 4:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: The fact that you're willingly just throwing her aside is just bad
6/15/19, 4:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Where did I say this
6/15/19, 4:45 PM - Jenit Jain: You just assumed
6/15/19, 4:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No
6/15/19, 4:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You're choosing Arav over her is also wrong
6/15/19, 4:45 PM - Jenit Jain: I was giving you information about what happened and you just jumped to a conclusion
6/15/19, 4:45 PM - Jenit Jain: That's my decision
6/15/19, 4:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya it's wrong
6/15/19, 4:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
6/15/19, 4:49 PM - Jenit Jain: And who are you to jump to this conclusion without knowing either of them even adequately well
6/15/19, 4:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You've known her longer
6/15/19, 4:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Babu how does it matter
6/15/19, 4:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And she's also your friend
6/15/19, 4:49 PM - Jenit Jain: I've known my school friends the longest but it's not like they are my closestttt friends no.
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I didn't like it
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Jenit Jain: And Manipal ones less than 3 years
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Jenit Jain: But you know the lengths I will go for them
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You should've been at least wanting to listen to her side
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Jenit Jain: It's not like that
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You were legit badmouthing her to me
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Is this what you do about me to other people
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Jenit Jain: Idm listening it's just that I know what it will be. She'll start retracting step by sgep
6/15/19, 4:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You always tell everyone everything na
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Jenit Jain: You please stop this.
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Not really but okay
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Nothing can ever be just between us
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya it's true I know
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Jenit Jain: If you think so
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: They always know full story of everything
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's not supposed to be shared
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Like I don't even know how to handle you RN because you're just assuming stuff and getting pissed because of it.
6/15/19, 4:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You were not supposed to share something she did wrong with me
6/15/19, 4:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Protect her not demean her
6/15/19, 4:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: This is not how you're supposed to do
6/15/19, 4:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Why should I protect someone who defaming someone else for the laughs.
6/15/19, 4:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause she's your friend
6/15/19, 4:53 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm sorry jeez. I just wanted to tell because it was kinda funny how things took a turn and it was a drunken night so that adds a funny element. And Priyanka missed her flight because she was too drunk to wake up is even more hilarious. WHY CANT YOU SEE THE REASON I TOLD YOU THE THING. YOURE FIGHTING FOR A BS REASON.
6/15/19, 4:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah well since she did it to my other friend I'm not going to interfere. Which is what I'm doing
6/15/19, 4:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: IT'S NOT FUNNY WHEN YOU CALL ME IMMATURE YOU DUMBO
6/15/19, 4:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm going to the gym
6/15/19, 4:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't wanna talk about this anymore
6/15/19, 4:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Honey, you can learn how to defend yourself. And argue back,which you did, so it's fine.
6/15/19, 4:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: If you talk bullshit I will call it
6/15/19, 4:56 PM - Jenit Jain: On the other hand you don't remove time for me in ldr. It's pissing off for me too, so I decide hey I'll tell dikshita a funny story so we can talk. But no. In that story also you will remove something to fight.
6/15/19, 4:56 PM - Jenit Jain: And then you send such conversation stopper messages
6/15/19, 4:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like LDR I already told you
6/15/19, 4:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's not funny
6/15/19, 4:56 PM - Jenit Jain: So you just stop giving a fuck about a relationship you've invested so much time in?
6/15/19, 4:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't find it funny
6/15/19, 4:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah well Priyanka was laughing at her situation so fuck you. If she can find it funny then even others can.
6/15/19, 4:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So now you get why you're wrong with Priyanka ?
6/15/19, 4:57 PM - Jenit Jain: You're really unbelievable.
6/15/19, 4:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I'm right
6/15/19, 4:59 PM - Jenit Jain: If I did some shit and then you stop giving a fuck about the relationship then the situation is similar. Moreover, it still won't be equal because my investment in the relationship has been WAY more than my investment in my friendships, especially Priyankad
6/15/19, 4:59 PM - Jenit Jain: I have my priorities in place at least. More than what I can say for you.
6/15/19, 5:05 PM - Jenit Jain: Reply
6/15/19, 5:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: This message was deleted
6/15/19, 5:06 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's similar
6/15/19, 5:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Not even close
6/15/19, 5:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Not even a bit
6/15/19, 5:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's not the point I was trying to explain why you're wrong
6/15/19, 5:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: So even if investment is less
6/15/19, 5:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Doesn't mean it's completely different
6/15/19, 5:08 PM - Jenit Jain: And I'm explaining why I'm not wrong
6/15/19, 5:09 PM - Jenit Jain: What about this ha
6/15/19, 5:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Reply to this
6/15/19, 5:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: My priorities ?
6/15/19, 5:09 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What's wrong with that ?
6/15/19, 5:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Ldr wouldn't have been a problem if I guess this relationship / I was more important than you know your normal friends.
6/15/19, 5:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Since your investment is equal in both cases or probably less in mine.
6/15/19, 5:10 PM - Dikshita Kothari: LDR has alwaysssss been a problem
6/15/19, 5:10 PM - Jenit Jain: 100 times you've tried no
6/15/19, 5:11 PM - Jenit Jain: Dont darecompare me to mahiman
6/15/19, 5:11 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I just know it
6/15/19, 5:11 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not
6/15/19, 5:11 PM - Jenit Jain: How many days did you know him for before starting ldr, 10?
6/15/19, 5:11 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I know how I get in an ldt
6/15/19, 5:11 PM - Dikshita Kothari: 5 years maybe more
6/15/19, 5:11 PM - Jenit Jain: You don't have any explanation then for problem with ldr except misplaced priorities
6/15/19, 5:12 PM - Jenit Jain: And met him for 10 days on a stretch
6/15/19, 5:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What misplaced priority?
6/15/19, 5:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not comparing
6/15/19, 5:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I know why ldr is hard for me
6/15/19, 5:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Bas
6/15/19, 5:13 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You want me to prioritise you above who?
6/15/19, 5:13 PM - Jenit Jain: That normal friendships and a 3 year relationship don't have a difference for you. And since they are different for me, thats the reason I can conclude that Priyanka was wrong fast enough
6/15/19, 5:13 PM - Jenit Jain: Please share
6/15/19, 5:14 PM - Jenit Jain: Idc who you put me above. I'm just saying that I'm clearly it above your friends hence you think that the Priyanka thing is wrong.
6/15/19, 5:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Moreover you should be deciding that. All I can do is accept my poor fate.
6/15/19, 5:26 PM - Jenit Jain: And you shut off your mobile data when you feel like it so you don't have to reply anymore. Running away from arguments is so typical of you.
6/15/19, 5:37 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Kyunki it's not the same
6/15/19, 5:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Thabks for failing the test of time.
6/15/19, 5:39 PM - Jenit Jain: You're not replying only to the other messages
6/15/19, 5:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm out with Mom
6/15/19, 5:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't accept it
6/15/19, 5:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You can leave whenever the fuck you want
6/15/19, 5:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya that one's on me
6/15/19, 6:00 PM - Jenit Jain: You tell me if you're up for dating man I don't want to be such a liability in your life
6/15/19, 6:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Because that's sure how you're treating me rn
6/15/19, 6:01 PM - Jenit Jain: You don't even think twice before talking.
6/15/19, 7:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What Jen
6/15/19, 7:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Anything I say pisses you off
6/15/19, 7:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I'm not treating you well
6/15/19, 7:50 PM - Jenit Jain: You know such thing pisses both of us off
6/15/19, 7:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not in that headspace rn
6/15/19, 7:51 PM - Jenit Jain: It's fine fuck it. I love you anyway
6/15/19, 7:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I actually mean it Jen
6/15/19, 7:51 PM - Jenit Jain: What'd you mean
6/15/19, 7:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I mean if I can't keep you happy
6/15/19, 7:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I shouldn't hold you back
6/15/19, 7:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't you want to work on the relationship instead of this
6/15/19, 7:52 PM - Jenit Jain: What happened talk to me
6/15/19, 7:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Is it because of the vidushi situation
6/15/19, 7:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I've tried
6/15/19, 7:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Firse last sem ka repeat nahi chahiye for you

6/21/19, 9:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Hello sir this is Jenit here.
This is regarding the post made on smartminds facebook page.
Smartminds wants to take credit for my results yet the institute discredited my achievements and did not treat me the same way as the other toppers, all because I did not agree to sign an ambiguous document which would in turn be used to wrongly defame other institutions that have contributed equally to my education. 
I don't think what was done to me was right and now using my name for publicity isn't ethical hence I would like you to take the video down from the Facebook page and the YouTube channel immediately.
6/21/19, 9:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Thanking You 
Jenit Jain

7/4/19, 7:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Till July
7/4/19, 7:07 PM - Dikshita Kothari: When we meet
7/4/19, 7:09 PM - Jenit Jain: is this because of what happened yesterday
7/4/19, 7:10 PM - Jenit Jain: the do whatever you want. im still on your leash and plan to stay
7/4/19, 7:15 PM - Jenit Jain: just do me a favour and go home and talk to me properly so that even i understand properly what you are going through because it is not fair to me that you bring up the past mistakes everytime. I need you to get over them and accept them and accept that i fucked up. I understand that you need a break and that you shall have. But for a healthier future, i need you to keep the past where it belongs because i cant afford a break every time we do long distance (which can happen a lot in case we get different colleges)/
7/4/19, 7:19 PM - Jenit Jain: your mental health is very important to me and hence i shall do my best to do whatever to get your mind some peace. if except the break theres anyway i can help you then please let me know, because you know i'll forever be by your side

7/5/19, 6:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If I want to do something that you disapprove of
7/5/19, 6:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You'll give me stuff like
7/5/19, 6:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Main maar doonga and all that
7/5/19, 6:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't accept that
7/5/19, 6:39 AM - Jenit Jain: Extra but okay
7/5/19, 6:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No this is exactly what you say
7/5/19, 6:39 AM - Jenit Jain: If you say so
7/5/19, 6:39 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So there are two things that I have done that you disapprove of
7/5/19, 6:40 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I spoke to saurak and apologized
7/5/19, 6:40 AM - Jenit Jain: I still disapprove of that
7/5/19, 6:40 AM - Jenit Jain: And will never back away from that I'm sorry
7/5/19, 6:41 AM - Jenit Jain: I could have handled it better while disapproving of it, so sorry I couldn't do better
7/5/19, 6:41 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I apologized to pranjal immediately after you said it was okay but then you said no later and then when I asked you what you would do if I told you you said that maar doonga
7/5/19, 6:42 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Both I did on the last exam day
7/5/19, 6:42 AM - Jenit Jain: Haven't we discussed enough about this matter already?
7/5/19, 6:43 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I couldn't share this with you
7/5/19, 6:43 AM - Jenit Jain: What you couldn't?
7/5/19, 6:43 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause I don't feel like I can share anything with you anymore
7/5/19, 6:44 AM - Jenit Jain: You can honey. You always can. Not talking is what crumbles the relationship.
7/5/19, 6:44 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I missed you a lot lesser than I had on any previous holidays
7/5/19, 6:44 AM - Jenit Jain: I understand why you didn't tell me about kt. And I've moved passed it.
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Jenit Jain: But that doesn't mean I'll be okay with you not telling me things
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Because finally I got the chance to do what I want
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Jenit Jain: What are you implying
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Jenit Jain: Like what?
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Without running everything past you
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Whatever
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Jenit Jain: That doesn't answer the question
7/5/19, 6:45 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If you were there you probably would've had a problem with vedant vatsal as well
7/5/19, 6:46 AM - Jenit Jain: Since you didn't run anything past me and are feeling better about it then tell what you didn't run past me that is making you feel so good
7/5/19, 6:46 AM - Jenit Jain: I've never had in the past also.
7/5/19, 6:46 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you right
7/5/19, 6:46 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Saurak and pranjal ka thing
7/5/19, 6:46 AM - Jenit Jain: All this assumptions from your end is affecting the relationship and always has
7/5/19, 6:47 AM - Jenit Jain: And?
7/5/19, 6:47 AM - Dikshita Kothari: That's all
7/5/19, 6:47 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm not understanding what you're implying
7/5/19, 6:47 AM - Jenit Jain: .
7/5/19, 6:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Hmm
7/5/19, 6:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I liked my vacation because I didn't have to tell you what I was doing when every minute of everyday
7/5/19, 6:50 AM - Jenit Jain: Why do you think I'm a bad person. Yes I've fucked up a lot. Yes I'm possessive of you. Yes I'm trying to change. I do everything to change myself for self improvement and so that I can be a better bf because you deserve that good. All I want is your happiness and I try to give you that. Yes my selfishness does hinder that sometimes and I accept my fault there. But you assuming the worst from me Everytime and taking precautions like not telling me stuff doesn't make the relationship any stronger than before. It in fact weakens it.
7/5/19, 6:51 AM - Jenit Jain: Yeah I kinda disliked my vacation because I didn't know everything you did which makes me feel less integral part of your life. Which I probably am now
7/5/19, 6:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Jen
7/5/19, 6:52 AM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita you need to accept one thing, right now itself, you don't need my permission to do anything. All i want to know is what you're doing. After that you're a person yourself and can make your own decisions
7/5/19, 6:52 AM - Jenit Jain: Is asking for an update that bad?
7/5/19, 6:52 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You're awesome 
Thank you so much for doing so much for me
7/5/19, 6:52 AM - Jenit Jain: Because clearly I haven't really gotten much this summer and clearly this summer you're having too much fun
7/5/19, 6:52 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe it's who I am
7/5/19, 6:53 AM - Jenit Jain: Alright
7/5/19, 6:54 AM - Jenit Jain: Reply
7/5/19, 6:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like someone controlling me like you do
7/5/19, 6:55 AM - Jenit Jain: I've stopped doing that man
7/5/19, 6:55 AM - Jenit Jain: Why won't you believe it.
7/5/19, 6:55 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like someone continuously criticising my decisions
7/5/19, 6:55 AM - Jenit Jain: Like what
7/5/19, 6:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Name instances
7/5/19, 6:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Making friends
7/5/19, 6:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And even I don't like criticising yours
7/5/19, 6:56 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You know what you have done Jen
7/5/19, 6:56 AM - Jenit Jain: You make friends man. I want you to make friends. You don't give a fuck about socialising it's not my fault
7/5/19, 6:57 AM - Jenit Jain: No I don't. I took pranjal from you. Fine. You can say that's my fault. Even though it was necessary and you didn't keep your word of handlong the situation. You have no idea how uncomfortable j was with our situation then. I kept telling your for months please handle it.
7/5/19, 6:58 AM - Jenit Jain: And yet you couldnt care enough.
7/5/19, 6:58 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You have very conveniently isolated me from all my guy friends and now the only friends I have who are guys are your friends. I was supposed to make more friends in college and become more extroverted. And I was doing such a good job with it.
7/5/19, 6:58 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm uncomfortable with it now
7/5/19, 6:58 AM - Jenit Jain: When it comes to your other friends, I'm sorry they left. I really am. But it's not my fault they didn't care enough for your friendship that they left as easily as they did.
7/5/19, 6:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I love you as a person Jen 
I'm not sure how I feel about us being in a relationship 
It's like we have just stopped being in sync
7/5/19, 6:59 AM - Jenit Jain: You were not doing a good job. How many million times have you resisted from being an extrovert.
7/5/19, 6:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need that to be judged by you
7/5/19, 6:59 AM - Jenit Jain: And all those guys friends left you for you. Not for me. And the ones who have left you because of me, I've already accepted tbat
7/5/19, 7:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want to be judged by you anymore
7/5/19, 7:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And that's it
7/5/19, 7:00 AM - Jenit Jain: Is this how you break up?
7/5/19, 7:00 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm not judging.
7/5/19, 7:00 AM - Jenit Jain: As the person who has stuck by you everyday since you stepped into college, I'm giving my honest opinion
7/5/19, 7:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I have stuck by you as well or do you think it's just a one way street
7/5/19, 7:01 AM - Jenit Jain: You have definitely
7/5/19, 7:01 AM - Jenit Jain: And your opinion is the most important thing to me
7/5/19, 7:01 AM - Jenit Jain: I guess this is just a one way street
7/5/19, 7:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes it is
7/5/19, 7:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Elaborate the sync
7/5/19, 7:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I'm not like that
7/5/19, 7:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Wow
7/5/19, 7:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Everything I say pisses you off
7/5/19, 7:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Everything you say pisses me off
7/5/19, 7:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I want to be able to support you
7/5/19, 7:03 AM - Jenit Jain: You're talking about last se. Which was equally bad for both of us.
7/5/19, 7:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I want to be able to make us a team
7/5/19, 7:03 AM - Jenit Jain: Let's please try.
7/5/19, 7:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I want to be a team player

7/5/19, 8:05 AM - Jenit Jain: Then?
7/5/19, 8:06 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't feel the same way
7/5/19, 8:06 AM - Jenit Jain: That's the ldr taking
7/5/19, 8:06 AM - Jenit Jain: Can you please make me understand what this means
7/5/19, 8:06 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So try to understand my situation
7/5/19, 8:07 AM - Jenit Jain: Please talk for 2 mins
7/5/19, 8:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't
7/5/19, 8:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm in the flight
7/5/19, 8:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I can't hear you cry
7/5/19, 8:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Dad is beside me Jen stop it
7/5/19, 8:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Please make me understand
7/5/19, 8:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Please
7/5/19, 8:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Don't fly without telling me
7/5/19, 8:09 AM - Jenit Jain: Please get in air wifi
7/5/19, 8:09 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I want to be your constant
7/5/19, 8:09 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'll try
7/5/19, 8:09 AM - Jenit Jain: This is all I want to understand
7/5/19, 8:10 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't feel what you feel for me
7/5/19, 8:10 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't feel that way for you
7/5/19, 8:11 AM - Jenit Jain: Use more words
7/5/19, 8:11 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't love you like you love me
7/5/19, 8:11 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't for a long time
7/5/19, 8:11 AM - Jenit Jain: Since the pranjal thing.
7/5/19, 8:12 AM - Jenit Jain: ?
7/5/19, 8:12 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
7/5/19, 8:13 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I've been trying to tell you
7/5/19, 8:13 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But I think I shouldn't keep you in the dark
7/5/19, 8:13 AM - Jenit Jain: By not texting me much or communicatimg during the vacation
7/5/19, 8:14 AM - Jenit Jain: About this?
7/5/19, 8:14 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
7/5/19, 8:14 AM - Dikshita Kothari: About how I feel
7/5/19, 8:14 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you on the last exam day
7/5/19, 8:14 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you
7/5/19, 8:14 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But I couldn't do anything then
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Jennn
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You're my best friend
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Help me
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Help you and me
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita. If you think the pranjal thing was the initial deal breaker then I cant say anything. You were the girlfriend it was your job to keep the guys (the ones with such a humungous crush on you)away from us. And him saying those things on your birthday didn't improve anything
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No that's not your job
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Jenit Jain: It was yours
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's notttttt
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Jenit Jain: It's not mine Ik
7/5/19, 8:16 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You cannot decide who can and who can't talk to me
7/5/19, 8:17 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Kuch galat nahi kiya usne
7/5/19, 8:17 AM - Dikshita Kothari: A crush is a positive emotion
7/5/19, 8:17 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You broke that boys spirit and then laughed about it
7/5/19, 8:17 AM - Jenit Jain: You anyway decided to talk to someone which made me feel very uncomfortable for the most part of my relationship. I still accepted it as collateral for the relationship till I couldn't handle it.
7/5/19, 8:17 AM - Jenit Jain: Till that time even you didnt handle it
7/5/19, 8:18 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Don't make it look like my fault
7/5/19, 8:18 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm done with this contract
7/5/19, 8:18 AM - Jenit Jain: I gave you enough time.
7/5/19, 8:18 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Conversation
7/5/19, 8:18 AM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita your feelings weren't the only thing that were supposed to be taken care of in this relationship
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Jenit Jain: My feelings are equally legit
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Jenit Jain: And you didn't consider them for the longest time.
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And mine are not the same as yours
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Dikshita Kothari: And I cannot support your deekinhs
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Feelings
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Jenit Jain: And yes I know talking to them made you happy. But at the same time it crushed mine
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so sorry Jen
7/5/19, 8:19 AM - Jenit Jain: Alright
7/5/19, 8:20 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Exactly why I don't want to impose this relationship on you
7/5/19, 8:20 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Nothing to be crushed about
7/5/19, 8:20 AM - Jenit Jain: There's no imposition
7/5/19, 8:20 AM - Jenit Jain: Alright
7/5/19, 8:20 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm taking off
7/5/19, 8:21 AM - Jenit Jain: Have a safe flight.
7/5/19, 8:21 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Boradinh is complete
7/5/19, 8:21 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You too have a safe flight
7/5/19, 8:21 AM - Jenit Jain: Which?
7/5/19, 8:21 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so sorry
7/5/19, 8:21 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm really sleepy
7/5/19, 8:21 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't slept for a long time
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Send snaps from Russia and have fun.
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Sleep now.
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes I will
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Gn
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Jenit Jain: I love you.
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I won't stop being there for you
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Love you too
7/5/19, 8:22 AM - Jenit Jain: Okay
7/5/19, 11:22 AM - Jenit Jain: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MBEPqKKKx7XeQX8DhWJR53hrHWNuNrZK/view?ts=5d1b79ea
7/5/19, 1:06 PM - Jenit Jain: About the possessive part, you need to realise that you've been molested twice in Manipal. You've been molested twice while you were my girlfriend. It took a very heavy toll on me too (I'm sure not as big as it took on you) . This is why I was very skeptical of your friends which affected the relationship. Even with kt I felt uncomfortable till kaustubh vouched for him. Not like that turned out any better. You need to realise that all I've ever wanted is for you to be safe and sound. I was trying to protect you from the ugly world. I'm sorry I failed. 
Whenever you're in other cities, I never am exactly tensed for your safety since I know the type of boys you're with ( and I know they will protect you however sloshed they are and won't take advantage of your drunkness so there's nothing to worry about ). 
And about the pranjal thing. Dikshita we both need to realize that we both were at fault. I clearly couldn't have taken it any longer especially after the birthday text. And I am not strong like you to break up over the ultimatum that I gave you. And you let him cross the boundary on multiple occasions. Yes, he was your friend and I had no right whatsoever to interfere but at that time you didn't control it and I had to do something for me since I received no help from your side, otherwise, I wouldn't be comfortable in the relationship. It was very selfish what I did but know that I thought it would just improve our relationship over time since I removed an imaginary part. It saddens me to know that I was wrong.
7/5/19, 1:10 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm very saddened to hear this especially after everything we've been through. And that too because of the pranjal thing. That hurt me the most. Couldn't you select real over imaginary just this once?
7/5/19, 1:12 PM - Jenit Jain: I've tried my best to be the man you want because honestly, that's the best version of a person anyone (and I) can hope to be. I'm sorry I failed.
7/5/19, 5:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Hello I landed
7/5/19, 5:12 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It's 15 degrees it seems
7/5/19, 5:12 PM - Jenit Jain: Hi
7/5/19, 5:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I just received your texts
7/5/19, 5:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I shall read once I get everyone in
7/5/19, 5:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Sure
7/5/19, 6:24 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Niceeeeeee I'll have to see full once the wifi gets connected
7/5/19, 6:25 PM - Jenit Jain: whose data are you using now
7/5/19, 6:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Mine
7/5/19, 6:25 PM - Dikshita Kothari: International roaming
7/5/19, 6:26 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm reading your message
7/5/19, 6:26 PM - Jenit Jain: ok
7/5/19, 6:34 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Twice, first of all, how the fuck 
Second of all 
No it didn't take a toll on me 
What took a toll on me was the way you reacted to it and the long term effect. You removed such good friends Jen jinke liye maine man se kiya jo bhi kiya. I don't like removing people from my life unless they fuck up real bad Jen please. I told you so many times don't tell anyone about the molestation and don't bring it up again and again. Tum bolke nikal lete ho I have to relive it each time. But you didn't even understand that. You didn't understand that every time I see s p it all comes back because they became the price I had to pay for your discomfort. I don't pay people as prices Jen I don't. I told you so many times. You were never able to understand cause your thought process is different and I respect that. But I do not agree with it and this is a major issue for me. This is one of the reasons why I feel we're not in sync.
7/5/19, 6:34 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Pranjal ka issue is that 
I told you billion times
7/5/19, 6:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I feel that you isolated me from people who were helping me. I needed them. Complex components cannot be ignored.
7/5/19, 6:38 PM - Jenit Jain: That classmate kinda mishandled and you and anirudh.
Dikshita I don't understand how you can be against me when s p didn't do shit for you during such a critical time. That was the time they could have stood up for you and the failed miserably. How can you give me shit for such shits? Baby I know you don't like to pay the price with people which completely makes sense. But s p thing I can't retract and if you think that what I did with them was wrong (like taking them away from you) then I'm sorry but I don't regret it.
7/5/19, 6:38 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Huh which classmate
7/5/19, 6:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine I agree he was helping you. Like I could see that you really liked him as a classmate I won't deny. But it went overboard for me and you didn't handle it.
7/5/19, 6:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't care if they did something for me or not 
I didn't make friends with them cause I wanted something in return
7/5/19, 6:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Out of sync #2
7/5/19, 6:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Arre remember some class party thing
7/5/19, 6:39 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Oh god acha I remember
7/5/19, 6:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: See I don't even remember all that
7/5/19, 6:40 PM - Jenit Jain: This is messed up. If your friends don't stand up for you when you get molested then they aren't really worth shit. Now you're talking non-sense. Only out of sync #1 is legit.
7/5/19, 6:40 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No
7/5/19, 6:41 PM - Jenit Jain: What can I even say
7/5/19, 6:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita how can you expect your friends to back away like they did after getting molested
7/5/19, 6:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't expect anything from anyone and I've learnt this long ago
7/5/19, 6:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Nooooooo
7/5/19, 6:41 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm making friends for a good time
7/5/19, 6:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Forget about me, even the girls condemned that action. So you think only you're right acting all "don't expect this and that"?
7/5/19, 6:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not making them so that I can check their moral background
7/5/19, 6:42 PM - Jenit Jain: That's good.
7/5/19, 6:42 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Yahi toh problem hai ki you and I don't agree on anything
7/5/19, 6:42 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't really want to talk about s p thing because you're not making sense there. And I really can't help you with it if you think what I did with them was wrong.
7/5/19, 6:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And now you don't wanna talk about it
7/5/19, 6:43 PM - Jenit Jain: Baby we need to talk about things we don't agree on properly instead of just forgetting and moving past it
7/5/19, 6:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Time is 4:12 here
7/5/19, 6:43 PM - Dikshita Kothari: .
7/5/19, 6:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Because I don't see anything wrong in what I did.
Pranjal thing I still see some things that I should have done in a much calmer way hence I want to discuss that.
7/5/19, 6:44 PM - Jenit Jain: 2.5 hours back I checked
7/5/19, 6:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya
7/5/19, 6:44 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ballet tonight at the Bolshoi
7/5/19, 6:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't handle it right
7/5/19, 6:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Fancy
7/5/19, 6:45 PM - Jenit Jain: I agree.
7/5/19, 6:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not talking about anything that happened in the past
7/5/19, 6:45 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm talking about what I feel right now
7/5/19, 6:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay let's talk present.
I'm still sad that you didny handle pranjal for all the time I told you to. Which led me to fuck up.
7/5/19, 6:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I handled it
7/5/19, 6:46 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I did
7/5/19, 6:47 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't believe me
7/5/19, 6:47 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You don't trust me
7/5/19, 6:47 PM - Jenit Jain: From your side I never doubted and you know that
7/5/19, 6:47 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya so bas
7/5/19, 6:47 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's it
7/5/19, 6:47 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I handled it from my side and it was none of your business
7/5/19, 6:47 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
7/5/19, 6:48 PM - Jenit Jain: How did you handle that long inappropriate message from your birthday that made me feel very uncomfortable?
7/5/19, 6:48 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It was all positive emotion
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Usne mujhe touch tak nahi kiya hai Jen
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Not for me honey
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Ik
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya so he didn't even send it to you
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Ya so your reaction was stupid af
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Dikshita but negativity i got or no you tell me that first
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Dikshita Kothari: And taking kaustubh with you really pissed me off
7/5/19, 6:49 PM - Jenit Jain: How does that matter omg 🙄
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine this I won't say anything
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: The negativity I had to go through was much bigger than your negativity
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Much more
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Muchhhhhh
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: More
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Jenit Jain: You've gone through that negativity for few months now. I went with pranjal negativity for few semesters
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Much much much much much much more
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Jenit Jain: So let's not compare
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No
7/5/19, 6:50 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Just stop it
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah fine your class people also stopped talking because of the Domino so fine.
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: For semesters it seems
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I was with you
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I'm with you
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I won't go
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Wasn't that enough
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Won't go?
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No it wasn't
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You know why
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Cause you are too insecure
7/5/19, 6:51 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Out of sync #3
7/5/19, 6:52 PM - Jenit Jain: With pranjal I was never insecure
7/5/19, 6:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Won't go away
7/5/19, 6:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Then why did you do it
7/5/19, 6:52 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even accept that you're insecure
7/5/19, 6:52 PM - Jenit Jain: And tbh I was very insecure since 11th and till like almost 3rd sem. But I have noticed the improvement in me so I kinda disagree.
7/5/19, 6:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Baby I'll accept only the truth
7/5/19, 6:53 PM - Jenit Jain: I am insecure still. But nowhere near as much as you thinking. Like 20% of you think
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: I have told you already because I didn't want that extra negativity for me (it wasn't negative for you which tbh kinda irritated me but I get that he's your friend so can't say)
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No your insecurity is the main issue for everything
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Nononono
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: I disagree.
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: You isolated me from a lot of people
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Fair enough.
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I need this semester to get them all back
7/5/19, 6:54 PM - Dikshita Kothari: My decision is final
7/5/19, 6:55 PM - Jenit Jain: I made my peace with it last sem
7/5/19, 6:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Which
7/5/19, 6:55 PM - Jenit Jain: And may I ask who are these people
7/5/19, 6:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: It was more positive for me than negative for you during that time. I used to look forward to class. Jen you ruined a lot of things
7/5/19, 6:55 PM - Dikshita Kothari: .
7/5/19, 6:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Fine
7/5/19, 6:56 PM - Jenit Jain: I agree
7/5/19, 6:56 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Saurak 
Parth 
Nethraa 
Sandy 
Pranjal 
Rishabh 
Jayant
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Why the fuck do you want to talk to s p
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: I don't understand
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That's none of your business
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Have some self-respect
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Obviously it is
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I will not
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I miss them and I want to talk
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I forgave them
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Which
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Pretty low standards
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: That I will reconcile
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: With these people
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
7/5/19, 6:57 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Yes so be it Jen
7/5/19, 6:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Alright then.
7/5/19, 6:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Can't say anything to stop it so won't.
7/5/19, 6:58 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Thank you
7/5/19, 6:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Insecure thing I don't agree with. So I think you should let it slide.
7/5/19, 6:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Oh please
7/5/19, 6:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Whoever knows you knows you're insecure
7/5/19, 6:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: All the girls think it
7/5/19, 6:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: All my cousins think it
7/5/19, 6:59 PM - Dikshita Kothari: My mom thinks
7/5/19, 7:00 PM - Jenit Jain: This i don't agree with so this is definitely out of sync. Since I believe friends are supposed to be your protection from the world.
7/5/19, 7:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Well if your mom thinks the DEFINITELY
7/5/19, 7:00 PM - Dikshita Kothari: No I don't need them for that
7/5/19, 7:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay
7/5/19, 7:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Just STFU Jen
7/5/19, 7:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Alright
7/5/19, 7:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm here for you if you want
7/5/19, 7:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But not as a girlfriend
7/5/19, 7:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry

7/8/19, 11:46 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay thank you
7/8/19, 12:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Jheal shouted at me when I told her our thing. Good lecture I got. So all the girls are the same. And I'm the wrong one. I agree. Stuff I knew was right was clearly not. I see it now. Even with the s p thing. No matter what your reason is for wanting to talk to them and me being against it, I have no reason or right to stop you. Except just stating my opinion. I'm sorry for not keeping your individuality into account. You have been completely right all along and I've been a possessive prick all along. Even with the pranjal thing. I had no right whatsoever. No matter my uncomfortableness, all I could do (and did do) was express my discomfort. And I did. I shouldn't have done anything after that since you clearly just wanted him as a friend. I'm sorry that the domino effect cost you all your class friends.
7/8/19, 12:41 PM - Jenit Jain: I've been possessive I get it. I understand it. I'm ready to move to past that. 
I clearly want to state this.
I'm sorry that the past 3 years that I didn't give enough importance to your individuality and adapt to it. I'm sorry I made you bend to my ways. I guess indirectly I took advantage of your good nature in this way, I'm sorry about that.
7/8/19, 12:43 PM - Jenit Jain: I just want to comment on your out of sync things,
Somethings that you stated like me being insecure and all, that is definitely a problem that I promise to work on.
And other things that are out of sync, well they just make us who we are. They don't need to be in sync. My fault was getting you into my sync. What I want to do today onwards is respect the things that's are out of sync because your individuality is what's the most important to me and the thing I'm in love with and I would never want to change that or trade it with anything.
7/8/19, 12:44 PM - Jenit Jain: Have fun first. You're on an awesome vacation. Please don't think about all this till you get back to the hotel.
7/8/19, 12:49 PM - Jenit Jain: And I'm really sorry for not being able to come to Delhi.
7/8/19, 1:01 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Jenittt what can I say aiyo 
You realised this toooooo late 🙈 
I told you so many times that things are changing for me I don't know why you turned a deaf ear. There is no point in telling me all this now. I'm really sorry for not being able to reciprocate.
7/8/19, 1:02 PM - Jenit Jain: i never turned a deaf year. i just wasnt smart enough to understand what to do.
7/8/19, 1:03 PM - Jenit Jain: please dont say theres no point. all i need is one chance.
7/8/19, 1:03 PM - Jenit Jain: its never too late dikshita. i really am sorry and ready to give you what you want.
7/8/19, 1:07 PM - Jenit Jain: i know you dont love me as much as i love you and who can blame you. but if there is some love left for me then i urge you to give this a chance. i know we wont be starting in the same places in the relationship. but i dont want to think what this could have been without atleast trying my level best.
7/8/19, 1:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to change yourself to fit my ideals
7/8/19, 1:08 PM - Jenit Jain: lol no

If you make things *more* difficult for me I will stop talking to you. In fact that's all you're doing. You know you said I'll be there for you but all you're doing is making my life tough. So since you have so many people to help you out I suggest you chill with them and leave me out of it. Stay away from my friends. And if you can't keep it simple stay away from me as well.

7/27/19, 1:42 PM - Jenit Jain: It'll get better anyway. Making all this is just like keeping things suffocated. We'll eventually find the perfect amount of texting so just let it run its course
7/27/19, 1:44 PM - Jenit Jain: And pubg toh there should be no limit. It's fun time! So might as well with whoever can play and if we're playing and if we have fun we're just becoming better and getting used to things the new way

8/6/19, 2:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Waiting outside
8/6/19, 3:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Incase you're confused then let me just be clear, cheated on me with mahiman
8/6/19, 3:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Acha thanks for questioning my loyalty
8/6/19, 3:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: But okay
8/6/19, 3:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Why do you think so
8/6/19, 3:21 PM - Jenit Jain: How does it matter. Don't you have some other dick to attend to?
You know what you have done. Karma is right there behind you. 
I'll see you in hell.
8/6/19, 3:27 PM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need your bullshit jenit
8/6/19, 3:27 PM - Dikshita Kothari: Stop blaming me for something I haven't done
8/6/19, 3:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Something you haven't done recently definitely doesn't include mahiman
8/6/19, 4:08 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What is wrong with you ?! How dare you blame me like this
8/6/19, 5:14 PM - Jenit Jain: see dikshita, we both know that if you weren't guilty (which you definitely are lol) you wouldn't be so scared inside. And rn you are scared that I know the truth so deny all you want.
8/6/19, 5:15 PM - Jenit Jain: I was right to be possessive since you are such a person that you cheated on me. Since you know me well, you can imagine how good I must be feeling knowing that I was always right
8/6/19, 5:37 PM - Jenit Jain: Honestly dikshita all I wanted to do today is to let you know that *I know* what you did. And officially cut all our connections because I can't even be friends with such low lives like you. (Funny thing how you wanted us to be friends). Anyway that's all from my end!
8/7/19, 12:52 PM - Jenit Jain: What were you saying again? 😂
8/10/19, 10:46 AM - Jenit Jain: So Divya forwarded me your message. I was going to send the following message to her but I'll just remove the middle man and send it here. So just assume I'm texting this to divya
8/10/19, 10:46 AM - Jenit Jain: I would love to see her explain to me what happened in delhi. Plus I never even held hands or any fucking thing with somiya ever let alone suck some dick. Plus he couldn't even keep his dick intact before "finishing too early" 😂. So now it's not the fucking same at all. Moreover I don't have time to instigate people against her. I just need people to know that it wasn't entirely my fault and how much shit can hide behind her innocent face. Because everything just thinks that I'm the possessive shithead who caused the entire breakup. Knowing that my possessiveness was right all along (seeing that she did cheat on me with him), it gives me a sense of calmness that I was right all along. And yes she's right, I'm not a good judge of character, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted 3 years of my life behind a girl like her. And I didn't force you to accept any BS and you know it. She is too immature for me anyway seeing that she uses people just to satisfy her need for attention. And if she calls that her "newfound peace" then God save her.
8/10/19, 10:48 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Jen you can believe whatever you want
8/10/19, 10:49 AM - Jenit Jain: I'd love to hear any explanation you have if you want to give one. I'm sure it'll be interesting
8/10/19, 10:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You've already made up your mind that you're not going to listen
8/10/19, 10:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Then there's no point
8/10/19, 10:50 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm ready to listen if you wanna say
8/10/19, 10:50 AM - Jenit Jain: No pressure
8/10/19, 10:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: As it is it's not like we're ever going to be friends
8/10/19, 10:50 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So then for what should I clear it out
8/10/19, 10:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's just sad that for one text message you're questioning my loyalty to you for so many years
8/10/19, 10:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's not like I didn't meet mahi before when we were dating
8/10/19, 10:51 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I was a good girlfriend and I know it
8/10/19, 10:52 AM - Dikshita Kothari: You can believe whatever you want
8/10/19, 10:52 AM - Dikshita Kothari: The reason I broke up with you was just you jenit
8/10/19, 10:56 AM - Jenit Jain: Okay good talk.
8/10/19, 10:57 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
8/10/19, 10:58 AM - Jenit Jain: Did you cheat on me in the 3 years?
8/10/19, 10:58 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't cheat at all
8/10/19, 10:58 AM - Jenit Jain: Okay
8/10/19, 10:58 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Emotionally yes
8/10/19, 10:58 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But that also only towards the end
8/10/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: For that I'm extremely guilty and extremely sorry
8/10/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I understand why it's coming off as I cheated physically
8/10/19, 10:59 AM - Dikshita Kothari: But I didn't
8/10/19, 11:00 AM - Jenit Jain: You did cheat physically ??
8/10/19, 11:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't cheat physically
8/10/19, 11:00 AM - Jenit Jain: In Delhi?
8/10/19, 11:00 AM - Dikshita Kothari: No
8/10/19, 11:01 AM - Jenit Jain: I read the chats dikshita. I read everything
8/10/19, 11:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
8/10/19, 11:01 AM - Dikshita Kothari: So the kiss being spoken about was not a lip to lip-type
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Everything else was after the break
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Jenit Jain: What about the part where he finished too early??
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: .
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Sure
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Well at least I made you cum. More than I can say for your new endeavours😂
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Jenit Jain: You enjoy your shit
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Jenit
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Dikshita Kothari: If you want to listen you can
8/10/19, 11:02 AM - Jenit Jain: You do you
8/10/19, 11:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I don't know what that means
8/10/19, 11:03 AM - Jenit Jain: It means goodbye.
8/10/19, 11:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: I have never done that with anyone but you
8/10/19, 11:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Oh okay
8/10/19, 11:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Goodbye

8/10/19, 11:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: It's okay Jen
8/10/19, 11:03 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Goodbye

8/12/19, 12:48 AM - Jenit Jain: Jo karna hai karlo bhai
8/12/19, 12:49 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Same to you
8/15/19, 11:20 PM - Dikshita Kothari: What the fuck are you telling people? I did not cheat on you Jenit but now I really wish I'd left you the day you told me about somya. Why can't you just accept that it's not you that I want to be with and move on? There's no need for this hideous revenge type scene. I broke up with you cause of your anger issues and not cause of anything else. What I do after the break up is none of your business.
8/16/19, 1:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Meet me tomorrow if you can
8/16/19, 1:38 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Break time

8/16/19, 10:50 AM - Jenit Jain: This is my formal warning. Do not interfere in my friendship with Divya. You don't own her. 
Do that and I'll show you what vengeance is.
8/16/19, 10:50 AM - Jenit Jain: Peace.
8/16/19, 11:07 AM - Dikshita Kothari: Okay do what makes you happy 
Thank you for hearing me out
8/16/19, 11:08 AM - Jenit Jain: Right back at you
8/16/19, 11:21 AM - Jenit Jain: How can you say you didn't cheat even though you hooked up before russia? Seeing that you ended it one day before russia?
8/16/19, 11:21 AM - Jenit Jain: You yourself said you would be proud if you were stronger. So well that guilt is kinda your confession right?
