12/9/18, 10:11 AM - Jenit Jain: Hey Naveen,
I recently emailed you regarding my internship certificate. I haven't received a reply yet. Please respond at the earliest.
12/9/18, 4:58 PM - Jenit Jain: Are you seriously going to be this unprofessional?
12/9/18, 5:06 PM - Naveen Physiz: You should not tell me about professionalism, be thankful I have not written to your college about you unprofessional conduct at work including but not limited to bringing marijuana-infused brownies
12/9/18, 5:06 PM - Naveen Physiz: I will make sure that it definitely goes to in printed format to your future employer
12/9/18, 5:33 PM - Jenit Jain: I can't figure your fixation on not giving out a certificate, it's much easier for even your end to be done with this. While you writing to an employer or my university could be mildly disturbing, consumption in India isn't a crime, only possession is. Karnataka police won't investigate your case, Maharashtra police will find nothing on me here. But when that happens, why are you under the assumption that no one will hear about what goes down in the office, how you're all a part of the practice and you're just looking for something to pin me down with. Do you want to get investigated for the distribution of narcotics in a work-place? Do you even have a legal department to represent you? Nobody coerced you into getting high neither did anyone bring brownies to your office against your will, as per Indian Contract Law 1872, you're an accomplice in this setting and more liable than I am being the business owner. Save your business, avoid an investigation, send me my certificate so we don't have to do this again. It's just easier this way.
12/9/18, 5:36 PM - Jenit Jain: And trust me, I'm not blackmailing and neither should you. It's just that we can be done with this matter in a matter of minutes.
12/9/18, 5:37 PM - Jenit Jain: It's very juvenile for a business owner to stress themselves with problems that aren't even theirs
12/9/18, 5:54 PM - Naveen Physiz: I cannot care less, you were unprofessional with your behaviour at work and last time you spoke you were just saying things for which you should get lesson for, and I am not talking about any legalities here, I cannot care less about your existence but if you want me to give a certificate I can write about your conduct there. You are just an insignificant person who should get a lesson in life.
12/9/18, 6:15 PM - Jenit Jain: Speaking about unprofessional behaviour, weren't you gonna treat the interns with your "very green stuff" that you got from North? And weren't you disappointed in missing that night out? And if I can recollect correctly, didn't Mohit go high for a meeting? Maybe nothing would have happened if such behaviour wasn't being encouraged by the co-founder himself
12/9/18, 6:15 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
12/9/18, 6:47 PM - Naveen Physiz: Sure, keep this for when you have to show it to your employers, I am not writing anything good in your certificate
12/9/18, 6:47 PM - Naveen Physiz: You need a job lol
12/9/18, 6:47 PM - Naveen Physiz: Should have thought about this before opening your mouth
12/9/18, 6:56 PM - Naveen Physiz: Also the more you annoy me with your text worse for you
12/9/18, 6:56 PM - Naveen Physiz: Talk to Abhishek regarding it
12/24/18, 4:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay let's get facts clear.
I hadn't done anything but respect you as a boss till the very end.
I wasn't aware of the money crunch y'all were having. It's just that Rohan, who left less than a week before I did, got both, his certificate and money way before me. And that's the only reason I kept asking you for those things.
You could have given me a definite date but you failed to do so which led me to ask you for the things that I deserve three times.
I think me asking you for the money three times riled you up, which then pushed you to start insulting me over the slack channel. I hadn't done anything wrong except ask for a goddamn certificate and a paycheck. You weren't fair in the way you treated me as compared to Rohan. 
The only reason I started attacking you was that you started removing your frustration on me. 
You should be able to own up to your mistakes by providing me with the certificate and I'll own up to everything I've said in return. 
Let's please just end this childish feud systematically.
12/24/18, 4:48 PM - Jenit Jain: PS: I've never been intoxicated *at* work.
12/24/18, 4:50 PM - Naveen Physiz: Okay so i can remove that line and add some more remarks to help your future employer, and I was really busy with a lot of stuff and I didn't insult or made any remark to you, you were very mean and you get what you deserve for it. Take it as a lesson and know how to behave next time.
12/24/18, 4:51 PM - Naveen Physiz: `You weren't fair in the way you treated me as compared to Rohan. ` that's your opinion, I have never discriminated
12/24/18, 4:51 PM - Naveen Physiz: You should be able to own up to your mistakes by providing me with the certificate and I'll own up to everything I've said in return
12/24/18, 4:51 PM - Naveen Physiz: ^ I have given you the certificate
12/24/18, 4:51 PM - Naveen Physiz: Abhishek sent it to you
12/24/18, 4:51 PM - Naveen Physiz: and also your friend is telling me about my financial status, really do you expect to get anything after that
12/24/18, 4:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Not on the job, I'm talking about the events that took place after our internships got over
12/24/18, 4:52 PM - Naveen Physiz: If I get a message again from you trust me it will not be good for you
12/24/18, 4:52 PM - Naveen Physiz: Because of your ill manners
12/24/18, 4:52 PM - Jenit Jain: You started texting me on slack saying that you're worthless and what not and your programs don't work even though I briefed you on the entire thing.
12/24/18, 4:52 PM - Naveen Physiz: You have got your certificate and we have on camera you getting brownies and making everyone eat
12/24/18, 4:53 PM - Naveen Physiz: I never said worthless to you but what you did on internship
12/24/18, 4:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Everyone wanted to have them and no one knew a source
12/24/18, 4:53 PM - Naveen Physiz: it did not work as expected multiple times
12/24/18, 4:53 PM - Naveen Physiz: Not my problem and everyone else not like you
12/24/18, 4:53 PM - Jenit Jain: You also have the screenshot of you bribing your interns with thc for increased productivity
12/24/18, 4:54 PM - Naveen Physiz: okay cool
12/24/18, 4:54 PM - Naveen Physiz: show it to your employers as defence
12/24/18, 4:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Man I didn't do jack shit except just ask for my things.
12/24/18, 4:54 PM - Naveen Physiz: I don't need a job you do my friend
12/24/18, 4:54 PM - Naveen Physiz: Really
12/24/18, 4:54 PM - Naveen Physiz: do you remember talking about statistics
12/24/18, 4:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Why do you want to include the legalities
12/24/18, 4:55 PM - Jenit Jain: No sorry I don't.
12/24/18, 4:55 PM - Naveen Physiz: Then it is even worse
12/24/18, 4:55 PM - Naveen Physiz: You deserve this even more
12/24/18, 4:55 PM - Naveen Physiz: You have your certificate and stipend paid
12/24/18, 4:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Naveen let's just forget this bullshit. We both have other important things to do. Can we just end this on peaceful terms that won't cause harm to any party
12/24/18, 4:55 PM - Naveen Physiz: Please don't bother me
12/24/18, 4:56 PM - Jenit Jain: Are you really serious about that bullshit of a certificate you gave me
12/24/18, 4:56 PM - Naveen Physiz: You should have thought about it when you said that startups like us shutdown and what now
12/24/18, 4:56 PM - Naveen Physiz: Yes 100%
12/24/18, 4:56 PM - Naveen Physiz: you don't decide the certificate
12/24/18, 4:56 PM - Jenit Jain: You started insulting me which is the reason I said all that
12/24/18, 4:56 PM - Naveen Physiz: And there is jackshit you can do about it
12/24/18, 4:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Everyone in the company knows that I love what physiz did
12/24/18, 4:57 PM - Naveen Physiz: I did not insult you at all
12/24/18, 4:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Look around you and ask anyone
12/24/18, 4:57 PM - Naveen Physiz: I said what you did was worthless
12/24/18, 4:57 PM - Naveen Physiz: and you were telling me statistics about startups
12/24/18, 4:57 PM - Jenit Jain: You are basically attacking me since it wasn't worthless.
12/24/18, 4:58 PM - Naveen Physiz: No it did not work, it may have some worth otherwise
12/24/18, 4:58 PM - Naveen Physiz: but let's end it here
12/24/18, 4:58 PM - Jenit Jain: I haven't denied anything you've said because I know everything I said. You own up to everything you've said and then we can take the next step to a systematic conclusion
12/24/18, 4:58 PM - Naveen Physiz: You are not going to get anything and learn this lesson in life
12/24/18, 4:59 PM - Naveen Physiz: All the best, have a great future!
12/24/18, 4:59 PM - Naveen Physiz: The conclusion is you have your certificate which we were obliged to give and you don't get to decide what goes inside certificate
12/24/18, 5:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Everything is a lie
12/24/18, 5:00 PM - Naveen Physiz: Till now you were giving threats and had a tone of so much aggression and also asked your friend to talk shit to me
12/24/18, 5:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Which voids the certificate
12/24/18, 5:00 PM - Naveen Physiz: that's your opinion
12/24/18, 5:00 PM - Jenit Jain: Give me a proof for every line and I'll leave you alone.
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Naveen Physiz: Why should I give YOU a proof
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Naveen Physiz: you were hired not otherwise
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Naveen Physiz: your code is in dumps and is not being used
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Naveen Physiz: we haven't implemented anything you did
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Naveen Physiz: you have zero manners
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Naveen Physiz: what else?
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Well that's your loss
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Jenit Jain: Since I'm receiving the certificate
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Naveen Physiz: This attitude is not helping you
12/24/18, 5:01 PM - Jenit Jain: And I deserve the certificate which reflects me
12/24/18, 5:02 PM - Jenit Jain: And not lies
12/24/18, 5:02 PM - Naveen Physiz: No that's not how it works
12/24/18, 5:02 PM - Naveen Physiz: Last message here

12/28/18, 3:09 PM - Naveen Physiz: I see you stalking my profiles, I hope you have learned your lesson, I am ready to give you an updated certificate if you write an apology email.
12/28/18, 3:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Since IAESTE require proof of everything on the CV, I'd like you to include the facts that I worked on models for crop classification and detection, disease detection and integration of the models to the webpage (worked with Rohan using Flask for this). Do you approve?
12/28/18, 3:48 PM - Naveen Physiz: Yeah

12/28/18, 4:58 PM - Jenit Jain: This is to certify that Mr. *Jenit Jain*, a student of Manipal Institute of Technology, has successfully completed a summer internship as a *Backend Developer* from May 2018 - July 2018. Jenit mainly worked on developing models for the detection and classification of various crops and diseases by deploying several machine learning algorithms. He was also a part of the development team responsible for the integration of the models with the webpage. 

We found him to be technically sound and hard-working during his tenure with us.
