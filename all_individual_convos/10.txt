14/05/2019, 18:55 - Anjali Premjit: Even you know that

14/05/2019, 19:39 - Anjali Premjit: And Nethra also?
14/05/2019, 19:40 - Jenit Jain: Nethraa because she was a mental torture to dik. And a disgusting hypocrite.
14/05/2019, 19:41 - Jenit Jain: This I want to elaborate on
14/05/2019, 19:41 - Jenit Jain: Like one instance

14/05/2019, 19:41 - Jenit Jain: Then months later after nethraa and agrim started hooking up, they used to come to our place wayyyy to often.
14/05/2019, 19:42 - Jenit Jain: And then someone told me she was telling all the girls that it's so disgusting that apratim used those guys for the apartment
14/05/2019, 19:42 - Jenit Jain: I'm like???? Bitch it's my decision. So when I called out her hypocrisy, she still had excuses for that
14/05/2019, 19:43 - Jenit Jain: And she really was a shit roommate for dik. So that was that

08/08/2019, 18:38 - Anjali Premjit: Are you okay
08/08/2019, 18:39 - Anjali Premjit: How are you handling this
08/08/2019, 18:39 - Anjali Premjit: Not with breaking hands pls ffs
08/08/2019, 19:24 - Jenit Jain: Done
08/08/2019, 19:30 - Jenit Jain: I've never felt purer or cleaner. She was very toxic for me without me knowing it and fair enough my mistake. But now I know. I've realised that she confused her love with attention. Whoever gives the most attention wins. 3 years I gave. And then the ex started few months back I guess. I knew their fucking pubg wasn't just pubg. And then she liked that attention better. And now in this semester, she is using that pranjal guys attention to satisfy her need to fulfill ego. Divya shouted at her saying that dikshita you need to let that guy move on and not lead him on and she said that she doesn't want to stop talking to him. She confessed to me that she'd rather let her pranjal and kshitij be lead on than me. And I realised that I wasted 3 years behind a shithead like her but it's fine it was a good journey and j learned a lot and j matured a lot. Fuck them cheaters. I'm happy and at peace
08/08/2019, 19:30 - Jenit Jain: Thanks for listening lol
08/08/2019, 20:43 - Jenit Jain: Readddd
