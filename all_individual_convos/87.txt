02/08/2019, 15:26 - Jenit Jain: On text!
02/08/2019, 15:27 - Jenit Jain: Because I threatened one of her friends because he was being too icky. Like he's a small town boy and never stopped liking dikshita even after her telling him that nothing will happen. So I threatened him because on her birthday he sent her like 21things I like about you and bs. And the first thing was you're my diamond and more of such bs followed
02/08/2019, 15:28 - Jenit Jain: Long story short since I threatened that guy it acted as a domino effect and she most of her class friends and blah blah
02/08/2019, 15:28 - Jenit Jain: I don't regret doing it but well
02/08/2019, 15:29 - Jenit Jain: And that bitch has been pity dating me since I broke my hand because it was a tough time and she didn't want to make it tougher.
02/08/2019, 15:29 - Jenit Jain: Bs
02/08/2019, 15:29 - Jenit Jain: But yeah
02/08/2019, 15:29 - Jenit Jain: And the speed with which she moved on was too fucking surprising and she's toh toooo happy about it. So well fuck her.

02/08/2019, 15:45 - Sanitra Hegde: Oh god! 🙈🙄
02/08/2019, 15:45 - Sanitra Hegde: Let her rot in hell! Good riddance.
02/08/2019, 15:47 - Sanitra Hegde: Also let her be happy or sad. Moving on from her means that you’re unaffected by wtv happens with her. That’s your validation. Not downloading tinder bro. Don’t cheapen yourself
02/08/2019, 18:13 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
02/08/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: This year old meme is finally funny 😂

29/09/2019, 10:48 - Sanitra Hegde: Or making some weird expressions and saying some stupid shit
29/09/2019, 10:49 - Sanitra Hegde: Send a pic. As if you’re the hottest or something. If the friends are hot they won’t go out with you. Also most hot ppl are dumb af, eg the girl crying

29/09/2019, 11:46 - Sanitra Hegde: It’s a process bro.
29/09/2019, 11:46 - Jenit Jain: Dude this girl is so extrovert everyone there knew her.
29/09/2019, 11:47 - Jenit Jain: And she's a dancer, her dance was so weird
29/09/2019, 11:47 - Sanitra Hegde: What is the correlation with being and extrovert and being nice?
29/09/2019, 11:47 - Sanitra Hegde: You can’t dance for shit bro 😂 what you complaining for?
29/09/2019, 11:48 - Sanitra Hegde: I’m glad that guy went out. But next time keep your brains in your skull while deciding tho.
