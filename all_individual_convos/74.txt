13/09/2018, 20:16 - Jenit Jain: If you have nothing to do
13/09/2018, 20:18 - Priyanka Sahoo: Okii
13/09/2018, 20:32 - Priyanka Sahoo: Eyy come down
22/09/2018, 00:30 - Priyanka Sahoo: Do you have algo lab 6 codes?
29/09/2018, 22:51 - Jenit Jain: Whyd you deactivate your insta
29/09/2018, 23:08 - Priyanka Sahoo: Cause I'm unhappy with life. Needed a break from social media
29/09/2018, 23:11 - Priyanka Sahoo: i'll activate it once i feel good about myself
29/09/2018, 23:22 - Jenit Jain: Tell me
29/09/2018, 23:43 - Priyanka Sahoo: Eh it's just a bunch of self destructive thoughts which leads to the conclusion that I'm a horrible person
29/09/2018, 23:44 - Jenit Jain: Did someone tell you something
29/09/2018, 23:50 - Priyanka Sahoo: Nope, not really
30/09/2018, 00:09 - Jenit Jain: Vidit already told me
30/09/2018, 00:09 - Jenit Jain: Tell me when you feel like talking
30/09/2018, 00:09 - Jenit Jain: I'm here :)
30/09/2018, 00:10 - Priyanka Sahoo: It's not really related to that
30/09/2018, 00:10 - Priyanka Sahoo: I just feel like I'm not important to some people whom I thought cared about me
30/09/2018, 00:10 - Jenit Jain: Then telll
30/09/2018, 15:41 - Priyanka Sahoo: Thought you should know that mahima and saba are going to confront me about something tonight
30/09/2018, 16:41 - Jenit Jain: Do you know why
30/09/2018, 16:48 - Priyanka Sahoo: Mahima - maybe because of the misconception that I told vidit that she *wanted* to hook up w someone that night at big shot. but I only said that cause i was ranting to him about what saba had told me the morning after my drunk night and it was all related in that context. And I think he took it out of proportion and thought she was hooking up w someone and confronted her about it. there's a clear cut difference between _wanting_ to hook up and actually hooking up with someone
30/09/2018, 16:48 - Priyanka Sahoo: I have no idea what saba wants to talk about though
01/10/2018, 00:39 - Jenit Jain: So what Happened

20/04/2019, 15:46 - Priyanka Sahoo: like, I literally contributed to the mess by 1%
20/04/2019, 15:46 - Jenit Jain: They puked on the bed as well right?
20/04/2019, 15:46 - Priyanka Sahoo: yeah
20/04/2019, 15:47 - Priyanka Sahoo: jeet walked on the bed with shoes on
20/04/2019, 15:47 - Priyanka Sahoo: made the bed very dirty
20/04/2019, 15:47 - Jenit Jain: Harshit was really pissed when he came home

20/04/2019, 15:47 - Priyanka Sahoo: only priyank and jeet made the mess dude
20/04/2019, 15:47 - Priyanka Sahoo: no one did anything
20/04/2019, 15:48 - Priyanka Sahoo: everyone else was sitting and chilling
20/04/2019, 15:48 - Priyanka Sahoo: priyank smashed the cake on jeet's face
20/04/2019, 15:48 - Priyanka Sahoo: so the cake was literally everywhere on the floor, on the walls, on the curtains
20/04/2019, 15:48 - Priyanka Sahoo: then jeet walked all over the bed with those dirty shoes on
20/04/2019, 15:49 - Priyanka Sahoo: puked in the washroom and on the bed
20/04/2019, 15:49 - Jenit Jain: Sure?
20/04/2019, 15:49 - Priyanka Sahoo: 100%
20/04/2019, 15:49 - Priyanka Sahoo: nobody else even threw cake on jeet besides priyank
20/04/2019, 15:49 - Priyanka Sahoo: I was just sitting on one corner of the bed and it happened
20/04/2019, 15:50 - Priyanka Sahoo: <Media omitted>
20/04/2019, 15:50 - Priyanka Sahoo: there was no need to point it out like that
20/04/2019, 15:51 - Priyanka Sahoo: I'm not paying for this shiz
20/04/2019, 15:52 - Jenit Jain: Sont
20/04/2019, 15:52 - Jenit Jain: Exactly
20/04/2019, 15:52 - Jenit Jain: This is why he doesn't get girls
20/04/2019, 15:52 - Priyanka Sahoo: he legit has no shame
20/04/2019, 15:53 - Priyanka Sahoo: apparently he told sasha that he'll call me up and tell me to pay
20/04/2019, 15:53 - Jenit Jain: Balls
20/04/2019, 15:53 - Jenit Jain: See it's jeets birthday today so I personally don't want to get into it today. But if harshit wakes up and says so what we need to talk this out, then we'll go up today itself
20/04/2019, 15:54 - Jenit Jain: If he calls you and tells you to pay, just blast him off
20/04/2019, 15:54 - Jenit Jain: Don't get pressurized
20/04/2019, 15:54 - Jenit Jain: Tell him y'all didn't do shit and the bill would be 36k without your presence as well
20/04/2019, 15:55 - Jenit Jain: And he should be ashamed because only he fucked up
20/04/2019, 15:55 - Jenit Jain: And hang up
20/04/2019, 15:55 - Jenit Jain: Pretty much what we're gonna sau
20/04/2019, 15:55 - Priyanka Sahoo: legit but dude, doesnt he have any decency? üôÑ
20/04/2019, 15:56 - Priyanka Sahoo: I thought I'd just ignore his call
20/04/2019, 15:56 - Jenit Jain: Or this
20/04/2019, 15:56 - Jenit Jain: Tell Sasha to tell Priyank then that you're not paying
20/04/2019, 15:58 - Priyanka Sahoo: yeahh, sasha mentioned that he'll talk to priyank
20/04/2019, 15:58 - Priyanka Sahoo: this entire situation is just awks
20/04/2019, 15:59 - Priyanka Sahoo: on top of that, how does he expect us to pay for the damage when jeet and priyank made the mess?
20/04/2019, 15:59 - Priyanka Sahoo: he was like "I dont think its right for one person to pay the entire due"
20/04/2019, 16:00 - Priyanka Sahoo: if the others went crazy and made the mess, then it makes sense
20/04/2019, 16:10 - Jenit Jain: I'm going to talk to raghav about this too
20/04/2019, 16:10 - Jenit Jain: Dw I'll leave you out of it

21/04/2019, 06:52 - Priyanka Sahoo: did y'all talk to him or something
21/04/2019, 10:47 - Jenit Jain: We want to know if Priyank actually told Sasha to call you
21/04/2019, 10:47 - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
21/04/2019, 10:48 - Jenit Jain: So when he does and pressurizes you then we'll go
21/04/2019, 12:43 - Priyanka Sahoo: sasha did call me yesterday but he told me to pay for the wine, shisha and the non smoking charges; I told him I'm not paying for the non smoking charges coz its not like I knew they booked a non smoking room
