22/08/2019, 17:35 - Jenit Jain: Okay so just an early farewell I guess but anyway
All the best for your new endeavors. Don't get into trouble. Try all the new things you can. Meet as many different kinds of people. Never ever settle for just 1 girl. Pay your bills one day before the deadline and not when you get the bill (trust me this is going to be too helpful). Talk to parents every week if not everyday. Make good memories and most importantly don't forget the OG ones :).
