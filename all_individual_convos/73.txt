19/07/2019, 01:47 - Praniti Mehta: I’m great ya, Whatsup w you?
19/07/2019, 01:48 - Praniti Mehta: Just been so busy working here in ATL
19/07/2019, 01:53 - Jenit Jain: Be texting you it if the blue kinda gives away the obvious I'm not doing great
19/07/2019, 01:53 - Jenit Jain: Summer vacations and after this final year no?
19/07/2019, 02:09 - Praniti Mehta: 😔😔
19/07/2019, 02:09 - Praniti Mehta: How are you coping?
19/07/2019, 02:09 - Praniti Mehta: Yasss
19/07/2019, 02:17 - Jenit Jain: Bad.
19/07/2019, 02:17 - Jenit Jain: Very bad.
19/07/2019, 02:18 - Jenit Jain: I feel someone is like feeding negative shit in dikshitas ears which is provoking her more. She has never spoken in such a bad way to anyone
19/07/2019, 02:18 - Praniti Mehta: What? Really? What did she say?
19/07/2019, 02:18 - Jenit Jain: 5 days she stayed in Delhi and she's already ignoring me for mahimam
19/07/2019, 02:19 - Praniti Mehta: But what did she tell you that you felt it?
19/07/2019, 02:19 - Jenit Jain: Man I can't explain
19/07/2019, 02:19 - Praniti Mehta: And like did you understand what she may have been trying to explain?
19/07/2019, 02:20 - Jenit Jain: 2 years I feel u comfortable because of someone and I'm supposed to get used to it. But when it's her turn to tell someone to maintain the distance because they send her inappropriate texts and when I handle it in a way she doesn't like it then you come to the conclusion after 3 years that our basics aren't same
19/07/2019, 02:21 - Jenit Jain: Yes that I did.
19/07/2019, 02:21 - Jenit Jain: But what happens when it comes to the fact that I wasn't comfortable when she was happy?
19/07/2019, 02:22 - Jenit Jain: Atleast she is supposed to understand my point of view so that she can make it a better environment for both of us
19/07/2019, 02:26 - Praniti Mehta: See firstly, the way you handled it regarding that guy texting her, may not have been the best! I can understand the concern from your side and like the basic protectiveness one feels. Do you really think those messages were inappropriate? Is it just this one person, you told her to maintain distance from?
19/07/2019, 02:30 - Jenit Jain: Men understand men better. Fine I may not have handled it in the best way but at least I asked dikshita to handle it for 2nyears. And even after someone downright rejecting your proposal and saying she's dating someone if the guy doesn't back out then you know something is up with him. And all these middle class boys from villages are like this only. You cant imagine. This guy can't talk in English. So a beautiful girl like dikshita giving him that much bhav is like his lottery ticket. He confessed when I was threatening him that he still likes dikshita. And the same he texted her that youre my diamond and what not bs.
19/07/2019, 02:30 - Jenit Jain: One person permanently. And I was just over protective when she went drinking with her class friends seeing that all of them are middle class as well
19/07/2019, 02:31 - Jenit Jain: And keeping in mind that dikshita has been molested twice in Manipal
19/07/2019, 02:31 - Praniti Mehta: My diamond? Are you serious? 🙈
19/07/2019, 02:31 - Praniti Mehta: Wtf?
19/07/2019, 02:31 - Jenit Jain: He wrote 21 such cheezy things for her 21st birthday
19/07/2019, 02:31 - Praniti Mehta: Handle it for 2 years as in?
19/07/2019, 02:32 - Jenit Jain: And then all her class friends chose that guys friendship than their friendship with dikshita. And then it's my fault and they don't give a shit about her friendship that they stopped talking to her
19/07/2019, 02:33 - Jenit Jain: I knew since the start that this guy was behind her so throughout the 2 years I kept telling her every once in a while that, yeah that guy, hmm just tell him to keep his distance. Friends with sab theek hai usko bolo crush apne pass rakhe.
19/07/2019, 02:34 - Jenit Jain: And for 2 years he had a crush on her. Little attention from a hot girl and it means that she should be hit on irrespective of whether she's dating or not.
19/07/2019, 02:34 - Jenit Jain: He *
19/07/2019, 02:36 - Jenit Jain: And another guy whom I told her the same thing, she's like no he toh considers me as his bro and all also confessed to his feeling at the start of this vacation.
19/07/2019, 02:36 - Praniti Mehta: See, I totally understand where you are coming from. I’ll speak to her! What I’ve been telling her and I wanna tell you also is that you’ll can’t give up so easily. Problems do come, need to sort it out. It might be at its worst rn but next semester atleast give it one more chance and then decide what’s best for both of you. You don’t find people who you connect with so strongly so easily.
19/07/2019, 02:36 - Jenit Jain: I found about it 2months later but yes men know men better
19/07/2019, 02:37 - Jenit Jain: I am not planning to give up anytime soon.
19/07/2019, 02:37 - Praniti Mehta: So have you’ll been talking or no?
19/07/2019, 02:37 - Jenit Jain: Although she will be ready to give up as I think her ears are being poisoned
19/07/2019, 02:37 - Jenit Jain: Barely.
19/07/2019, 02:37 - Jenit Jain: The reason I can't talk to you is that you make me very very very angry 
And then I'm rude to you and I bring up past things 
And then I hate myself for doing that to you 
Can you please understand that ?
19/07/2019, 02:41 - Praniti Mehta: By who do you think?
19/07/2019, 02:42 - Jenit Jain: [7/19, 2:41 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Jenit please
[7/19, 2:41 AM] Dikshita Kothari: I can't be anything for you anymore
19/07/2019, 02:42 - Jenit Jain: Either her sisters or that chut mahimam
19/07/2019, 02:42 - Jenit Jain: I don't love you like that anymore
19/07/2019, 02:48 - Jenit Jain: Also mahiman for sure
19/07/2019, 02:57 - Praniti Mehta: See I think she is super mad about you coming across as too protective and insecure but again I know where you’re coming from. For now, just give her, her space to cool down. If you keep talking to her about the same thing, one would just get frustrated and speak rudely. She is w her family rn so she may not be thinking about all of this so much. Just give it some time and give her same space to actually understand and see it from your perspective too.
19/07/2019, 02:57 - Praniti Mehta: When do you’ll get back to college?
19/07/2019, 03:16 - Jenit Jain: No her basis relies on that everything from my perspective is shit
19/07/2019, 03:16 - Jenit Jain: And that she doesn't love me anymire
19/07/2019, 03:16 - Jenit Jain: And that I'm not the right guy for her
19/07/2019, 03:16 - Jenit Jain: I'll see her on Monday if she agrees
19/07/2019, 03:17 - Jenit Jain: And like while discussing also rn she's like can I help you with anything else blah blah.
19/07/2019, 03:19 - Jenit Jain: She blames me for telling my friend that she got molested and she needs to be taken care of and she needs to leave the house where it happened because I wasn't in Manipal at the time. And mind you, my friend did take care and her and she got away from the place where the shit happened and kept her fucking safe.
19/07/2019, 03:19 - Jenit Jain: I have done everything in my power to keep her safe and away from shits. And surprisingly those are the reasons why she can't be with me.
19/07/2019, 04:09 - Jenit Jain: She actually gave a conclusion already saying that I don't feel any love for you and youre not the one for me
19/07/2019, 04:09 - Jenit Jain: And she framed it exactly like that
19/07/2019, 04:09 - Jenit Jain: So yes that's what's up with me right fucking now.
19/07/2019, 07:10 - Jenit Jain: Has dikshita asked you not to respond to me then let me know
19/07/2019, 07:13 - Praniti Mehta: No no, I’m so sorry, I’m leaving for NYC tomorrow so I got back home from work v late so just packing and stuff
19/07/2019, 07:13 - Praniti Mehta: I haven’t spoken to her only
19/07/2019, 07:14 - Praniti Mehta: How come?
19/07/2019, 07:14 - Praniti Mehta: Okay, that’s wrong. I had no idea about this
19/07/2019, 07:15 - Praniti Mehta: I can totally imagine, how upset you must be right now but let me speak to her and understand her perspective too.
19/07/2019, 07:19 - Jenit Jain: In Manipal
19/07/2019, 07:20 - Jenit Jain: I think her perspective is I don't want that anymore
19/07/2019, 07:20 - Jenit Jain: Oh that fucking mahiman I'm going to kill that guy one day
19/07/2019, 07:35 - Praniti Mehta: Okay relaxx, calm down
19/07/2019, 07:35 - Praniti Mehta: Let me just speak to her once
19/07/2019, 07:35 - Praniti Mehta: College starts?
19/07/2019, 07:35 - Praniti Mehta: So early?
19/07/2019, 07:35 - Jenit Jain: Yes
19/07/2019, 07:36 - Praniti Mehta: Ohh
19/07/2019, 07:37 - Praniti Mehta: So the most important thing I feel is that no matter how angry you feel, please please don’t be aggressive while speaking to her
19/07/2019, 07:37 - Praniti Mehta: If you have no plans on giving up like you said, the first has to be speaking to her super calmly when you do face to face
19/07/2019, 07:37 - Praniti Mehta: Like I can image all the different emotions you must be feeling but please please be super calm
19/07/2019, 07:38 - Jenit Jain: What am I supposed to about her blaming me for everything wrong in her life
19/07/2019, 07:39 - Praniti Mehta: You need to sit her down and explain point by point why you did certain things in a certain way- being completely calm. She may not respond the way you’d like but you have to have to give her time
19/07/2019, 07:41 - Praniti Mehta: Nothing is gonna happen by aggression/ anger or force. If she is saying that the love has gone: 
Options: 
1. Right now she is super busy w family and stuff, so she isn’t thinking about the whole picture, so it’s just the negative in her head. You need to remind her the positives and how happy you’ll were before and that you’ll can figure out and throw the negativity away
19/07/2019, 07:42 - Praniti Mehta: You need to make her fall for you naturally and for the reasons you’ll started dating in the first place
19/07/2019, 07:42 - Praniti Mehta: Anger, aggression and stuff is not gonna help at all. You have to be super calm and give her space and time
19/07/2019, 07:43 - Jenit Jain: Thank you I'll try that
19/07/2019, 07:43 - Jenit Jain: If you talk to her and find out something o should know please let me know that
19/07/2019, 07:44 - Praniti Mehta: And the most important, idk if you’ve already done that but you have accept your mistakes
19/07/2019, 07:44 - Praniti Mehta: Ofcourse
19/07/2019, 07:44 - Praniti Mehta: Like throwing her phone was definitely not right so just accept it
19/07/2019, 07:45 - Jenit Jain: I've accepted and apologised door everything anyway. I have nothing more to lose
19/07/2019, 07:46 - Praniti Mehta: Okay that’s good! 2 years is no joke, you need to remind her of all the beautiful things that you’ll shared in a natural way
19/07/2019, 07:47 - Praniti Mehta: And honestly, when I was in cal and we went to Mbar that night, it was so so evident that she loves you so much
19/07/2019, 07:47 - Praniti Mehta: In 1 month, such a strong feeling can’t fade away
19/07/2019, 07:47 - Praniti Mehta: It’s a phase, everyone normal person goes through it
19/07/2019, 07:47 - Jenit Jain: Apparently they have been fading since March
19/07/2019, 07:48 - Praniti Mehta: You just need to support her, be w her and remind her of the bigger picture
19/07/2019, 07:48 - Jenit Jain: If she even agrees to meet
19/07/2019, 07:48 - Praniti Mehta: Dude honestly, she wouldn’t have called you, sat in the bathroom for 30 mins talking just about you
19/07/2019, 07:48 - Praniti Mehta: If she didn’t have anything
19/07/2019, 07:49 - Praniti Mehta: She herself isn’t realising a lot of things because she is so preoccupied rn
19/07/2019, 07:49 - Jenit Jain: Exactly
19/07/2019, 07:49 - Jenit Jain: But the way she puts it is just so hurtful
19/07/2019, 07:49 - Praniti Mehta: I know how she happy was when your dad sent that message to your sister saying I met your bhabhi today
19/07/2019, 07:49 - Jenit Jain: The words that she uses
19/07/2019, 07:50 - Praniti Mehta: I know I know, it’s a phase. Trust me, one of you has to be strong. And rn it’s your turn to be
19/07/2019, 07:50 - Jenit Jain: She told me she didn't want to even be physical with me on the last day she just did it because she was drunk
19/07/2019, 07:50 - Jenit Jain: Like wtf man
19/07/2019, 07:51 - Praniti Mehta: Oh god. I don’t know what to say
19/07/2019, 07:51 - Jenit Jain: She has been pity saying be for months now
19/07/2019, 07:51 - Praniti Mehta: Let me just speak to her once
19/07/2019, 07:51 - Jenit Jain: Alright
19/07/2019, 07:51 - Praniti Mehta: Just that I know she is way too preoccupied rn to think anything properly
19/07/2019, 07:52 - Praniti Mehta: Like coming to conclusions is v easy but fighting through it is hard which everyone just runs away from
19/07/2019, 07:56 - Jenit Jain: I'm ready to fight and do whatever it takes
19/07/2019, 07:56 - Jenit Jain: She had already given up.
19/07/2019, 07:57 - Jenit Jain: And we both know her. She is not mentally steering enough to do any of this by herself. She is just listening too much from too many people
19/07/2019, 08:02 - Praniti Mehta: Yea I know what you mean and I feel half the people who might be saying crap don’t even know you properly
19/07/2019, 08:02 - Praniti Mehta: So are in no position to say anything at all
19/07/2019, 08:02 - Praniti Mehta: I might be wrong on this
19/07/2019, 08:02 - Praniti Mehta: Don’t know how well you know all of them but you know what I mean
19/07/2019, 08:04 - Jenit Jain: Her 5 day reunion with mahiman when she was single was just a vulnerability advantage that he took and is using it
19/07/2019, 08:04 - Jenit Jain: I just know it
19/07/2019, 08:05 - Praniti Mehta: Has she said anything regarding that?
19/07/2019, 08:06 - Jenit Jain: You think? She is too stupid to know when guys are being guys . Her gullibility is one of the reasons for the situation because I try to balance that out for her as well so she learns and grows up
19/07/2019, 08:06 - Jenit Jain: I'm telling you. Men know men
19/07/2019, 08:42 - Praniti Mehta: Yea I can understand
03/08/2019, 12:28 - Jenit Jain: Hey praniti
03/08/2019, 12:28 - Jenit Jain: I'd like to please keep this conversation between us and not tell dikshita if that's okay with you
03/08/2019, 12:28 - Jenit Jain: I need know how dikshita moved on so quickly
03/08/2019, 12:29 - Jenit Jain: I can't sleep knowing that a 3 year relationship ended just like that.
03/08/2019, 12:29 - Jenit Jain: I know mahiman was bad mouthing me.
03/08/2019, 12:31 - Jenit Jain: Is there anything going on with pranjal or kshitij or mahiman that makes her care so less. She tries and tells me that she wants to be friends but it's so surprising that she doesn't care that much anymore
03/08/2019, 12:37 - Praniti Mehta: Yes ofc!
03/08/2019, 12:37 - Praniti Mehta: There isn’t!! She just enjoys hanging out w them
03/08/2019, 12:38 - Praniti Mehta: I’ve had this conversation with her
03/08/2019, 12:38 - Praniti Mehta: And she said she doesn’t have anything w any of them but just pure friendship
03/08/2019, 12:38 - Jenit Jain: And this?
03/08/2019, 12:41 - Jenit Jain: I need closure so please tell me anything you can
03/08/2019, 12:41 - Jenit Jain: I need to know so I can move on too
03/08/2019, 12:56 - Praniti Mehta: I just feel that whatever happened, impacted her so much that over time it’s just all gone
03/08/2019, 12:57 - Praniti Mehta: I can totally understand how you feel
03/08/2019, 12:57 - Jenit Jain: I believe you. You seem trustworthy :).
03/08/2019, 12:58 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
03/08/2019, 12:58 - Praniti Mehta: I think you should tell her this and have a final conversation with her! Ask her everything you have doubts about in person
03/08/2019, 12:59 - Praniti Mehta: Like please don’t keep so much inside yourself and keep asking yourself what went so wrong
03/08/2019, 12:59 - Praniti Mehta: You need to speak to her
03/08/2019, 13:00 - Jenit Jain: She doesn't care enough and I can't have a conversation with such a person.
03/08/2019, 13:00 - Praniti Mehta: I’m genuinely telling you everything that I honestly feel! She herself hasn’t been able to explain it properly to herself or to me. Everytime I’ve asked her, she has always pointed out to the possessive and aggressive factor which we can’t deal at all
03/08/2019, 13:00 - Praniti Mehta: If you don’t, you’ll never get the closure you want
03/08/2019, 13:01 - Praniti Mehta: *she
03/08/2019, 13:01 - Praniti Mehta: Oh hahah lol
03/08/2019, 13:02 - Jenit Jain: It's fine then fuck it. No closure it is.
03/08/2019, 13:03 - Praniti Mehta: Don’t do this! Please just try and have one honest conversation with her
03/08/2019, 13:04 - Praniti Mehta: Be like, just keeping everything aside, can we honestly and openly talk about everything for one last time for mine and yours mental satisfaction
03/08/2019, 13:04 - Praniti Mehta: Please do it 🙏🏻
03/08/2019, 13:06 - Jenit Jain: I can't have a conversation with someone that disinterested in me well
03/08/2019, 13:06 - Praniti Mehta: Just keep everything aside for once
03/08/2019, 13:32 - Jenit Jain: How about you give me some insight into things she hasn't told me so I know what to talk about since I don't know where to begin
05/08/2019, 18:26 - Praniti Mehta: I’ve told you everything that I know so I guess there isn’t anything else, don’t over think it
05/08/2019, 18:30 - Jenit Jain: Alright thank you :)
08/08/2019, 09:02 - Jenit Jain: Hey praniti.
So I know about dikshita and mahiman in Delhi.
I've let her know that I don't want any ties with her.
I just want to tell you that these past 3 years, you've been an amazing friend and a very nice person. I have enjoyed your drunk talks and your help with everything. 
I have enjoyed our friendship and I'm grateful for meeting an awesome person like you.
All the best for your future.
See you (in case I ever make it to Gtech).
Bye bye :).
08/08/2019, 19:00 - Praniti Mehta: Hii, this is so sweet! Really means a lot! Same here 😊I really hope you make it to Gtech haha and I find a job here 🙏🏻 see youuu
