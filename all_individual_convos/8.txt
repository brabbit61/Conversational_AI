15/04/2019, 19:10 - Jenit Jain: Limitations and Improvements:
The algorithm runs till only n=10 because of single GPU, Golomb's ruler for larger values of n are computed using cluster computers so we couldn't implement that, also we are using global memory in kernel and each kernel defines an array to store the ruler which can be optimised by using shared memory. For efficient use of the GPU under heavy computation, we must run the parallelized form of the algorithm on clusters, and take advantage of the shared memory available.
15/04/2019, 19:31 - Amrit Goyal: Itna kaafi Hain?

21/10/2019, 00:36 - Amrit Goyal: How is it D?
21/10/2019, 08:42 - Jenit Jain: Because *p is basically the location of x
21/10/2019, 08:42 - Jenit Jain: And since *p (x) is on the lhs of =  that's why definition of the 2
