28/03/2019, 19:40 - Jenit Jain: No idea when you had to fill the application
28/03/2019, 19:43 - Vasvi Sharma: ._.
28/03/2019, 19:45 - Jenit Jain: Oh yeah right
28/03/2019, 19:45 - Jenit Jain: Well then I didn't get any link
28/03/2019, 19:45 - Jenit Jain: I had submitted with Maharashtra state
03/04/2019, 16:16 - Jenit Jain: Hey what was the LA portion for 2nd sessionals
03/04/2019, 16:21 - Vasvi Sharma: LA ?
03/04/2019, 16:21 - Jenit Jain: oe
03/04/2019, 16:21 - Vasvi Sharma: Linear transformation (full)
Inner Product Spaces(until orthogonal basis)
03/04/2019, 16:22 - Jenit Jain: orthogonal isnt included right
03/04/2019, 16:23 - Vasvi Sharma: It wasn't, but they asked a question that involved knowing the concept of it. So I suggest you go through it
03/04/2019, 16:51 - Jenit Jain: accha thankss
10/05/2019, 19:24 - Jenit Jain: Hey, what do we have to with the document you sent on group regarding getting an internship?
10/05/2019, 19:24 - Jenit Jain: Like there are only email IDs present so...?
10/05/2019, 19:36 - Vasvi Sharma: The purpose wasn't made clear to us either. You could try visiting their websites and see if its possible to apply directly for an internship position
10/05/2019, 19:36 - Vasvi Sharma: There are links to their webpages as well right ?
10/05/2019, 19:45 - Jenit Jain: But how is that different than us applying through those websites before? Internshala pure sem kata ðŸ˜‚
10/05/2019, 19:50 - Vasvi Sharma: I think because these specific organizations have signed and MoU with AICTE, getting an internship with them is easier ?
10/05/2019, 19:50 - Vasvi Sharma: Internshala is a scam ik xD
10/05/2019, 19:50 - Vasvi Sharma: An* MoU
10/05/2019, 19:54 - Jenit Jain: Hope so. If you get any clarification, please forward that too. Thankss
10/05/2019, 19:56 - Vasvi Sharma: Sure
17/06/2019, 13:42 - Jenit Jain: i registered for the tcs test but since im travelling to manipal on that day, i wont be able to sit for the test. Will that be a problem for me? like for my interviews after 20th.
17/06/2019, 14:06 - Vasvi Sharma: I'll find out and get back to you
17/06/2019, 14:09 - Vasvi Sharma: You're asking if you're going to be allowed to sit for other companies ? Since you'll be missing the TCS test ?
17/06/2019, 14:35 - Vasvi Sharma: <Media omitted>
21/06/2019, 18:23 - Jenit Jain: Thanks a lot
