27/08/2018, 00:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Jenittttttttt
27/08/2018, 00:02 - Jenit Jain: Pubg
27/08/2018, 00:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Haan aao
27/08/2018, 11:04 - Jenit Jain: I should be able to speak my mind freely of what I think about your friends
27/08/2018, 11:04 - Jenit Jain: And you have to listen to it all. And then do whatever you want
27/08/2018, 11:05 - Jenit Jain: You can't just get pissed Everytime I talk about them
27/08/2018, 12:01 - Dikshita Kothari: You should and you are and I'll listen to everything you have to say. I don't get pissed cause you're judging people. I enjoy hearing your judgements. I don't have a problem with you telling me what you think but with why you think it at all and how. 
By just their outer appearance and all you're judging them as 'ghati' it's becoming one of the more annoying words for me. 
Even your friends come across as bad influence and stoners and all. That's what I used to think about them before I spoke to them. I understand it's not possible to simply believe what someone says about someone else but at least you should try. 
Without speaking to any of them you have judged them as ghati. I don't even know why cause they're innocent sweet people who are here for a good time not for a long time. I'm not going to talk to them forever. So I don't understand why you simply have to bring it up allllllllll the time. Like everytime I say anything about any of them you'll say something insulting instead of trying to be nice. So I don't even feel like telling you about what happens in class and all. Cause I don't get the reaction that the story deserves. You're not the only one who should be able to speak your mind freely. 
And what am I even supposed to do if I listen to you just not talk to anyone in class? It's a distraction I enjoy having and you're kind of irritating me with your insults. Especially when you haven't even tried to talk to them once. Not even once. 
If you have any proof of them being ghati then I'll listen to you definitely without question. But if you don't then no I don't have to listen to your judgement all the time cause in my head it's not true. And "I just know" is not a good enough reason to simply harass me with this all the time. I wouldn't have told you if you hadn't brought it up making it seem like my fault but since you have let me make it very clear. I will not listen to anything about any of my class people unless you have proof that they have done something to deserve my hatred and negativity. And if this is too much work for you then no I do not have to listen to it all. Especially when you don't even have to converse with any of them. It's damn pissing off so I will get pissed. You can't expect me to not. Even you will get pissed if everytime you mention Soumya, Anushka or Rishabh and I simply insult them on no solid ground.
27/08/2018, 12:06 - Jenit Jain: You make so many valid points that it's pissing off
27/08/2018, 12:06 - Jenit Jain: Can't even argue
27/08/2018, 12:06 - Dikshita Kothari: Love you sweetheart
27/08/2018, 12:06 - Dikshita Kothari: No one ever wins conversations with me
27/08/2018, 12:08 - Jenit Jain: And I have already told you that I have no problems with you talkimg to them. It's just that I need you to know I don't trust any of them with anything. If you do, which you do, then I'm glad. But my insecurities rekindle not because they try to hit on you all ( which the prolly do and it's fine because if it wasn't fine then you would have handled it yourself) but because I feel anxious for your security around them
27/08/2018, 12:09 - Jenit Jain: So thats why I keep calling and all when you're like getting drunk with them and all
27/08/2018, 12:09 - Jenit Jain: I'm not talking about hooking up, I'm scared for the inappropriate behavior
27/08/2018, 12:11 - Dikshita Kothari: Everyone hits on me all the time da but these guys really don't. Pranjal does definitely but it's like chill type not Majnu type. No reason to simply break a one year long friendship over. Drinking and all ya I'll not go with them anymore not cause they aren't behaving properly but cause I don't behave properly when I drink. Class mein toh no problem is there at all. Everyone always helps each other and there's no complication at all.
27/08/2018, 12:20 - Jenit Jain: See I don't want you not to hang out with your actual friends especially seeing I fuck up your friendships more than you fuck them up. So incase you feel you are just little tipsy but acting weird, I can always pick you up
27/08/2018, 12:20 - Jenit Jain: But yeah I don't have any issues with you chilling with them except the safety thing
27/08/2018, 12:29 - Dikshita Kothari: Dude after drinking and all I become damn out of control like do stuff I'd never do if I was sober but you toh already know that. So ya I don't want to give them any wrong ideas and all so I'll not drink. I'm safe da. So many people are there in all these pubs and all who will do anything. You can't tell who's safe when. If I wasn't safe in your house who's to say I'm safe anywhere. It's not good to simply keep thinking about it and forget to have fun but I'm definitely not saying that it's not important
27/08/2018, 12:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't ever think you fuck up anything. You just do it in a different way than I would have
27/08/2018, 13:01 - Jenit Jain: Needed to hear thay

04/09/2018, 12:14 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya
04/09/2018, 12:28 - Dikshita Kothari: Hi.
04/09/2018, 12:28 - Dikshita Kothari: Whatever happened yesterday could've been conveyed to you in a much better way, and my intention wasn't to hurt you. I just think that you and jenit made it very evident that you didn't want to be friends with us after the drama last sem so I think it's for the best if instead of awkwardness and need for fakeness, we just accept that we're all unrelated now
04/09/2018, 12:28 - Dikshita Kothari: You won't have to put up with us, and vice versa
04/09/2018, 12:28 - Dikshita Kothari: If you felt bad about what I did yesterday, I'm sorry for not handling it better. I didn't know parth had called you over. Hope you can understand that I'm only doing this to put an end to any unnecessary drama that would've happened over time
04/09/2018, 12:32 - Jenit Jain: Nothing we were doing dude
04/09/2018, 12:32 - Jenit Jain: And why is he saying us
04/09/2018, 12:32 - Jenit Jain: You weren't talking to anyone who didn't wanna talk to you
04/09/2018, 12:32 - Jenit Jain: Neither was i
04/09/2018, 12:33 - Jenit Jain: I said only to those people who wouldn't mind talk to me and same for you
04/09/2018, 12:33 - Jenit Jain: That's some serious bs right thete
04/09/2018, 12:34 - Jenit Jain: You're talking to everyone except nethraa
04/09/2018, 12:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Legit in that conversation when you were not in the room I told her I don't want to be roommates but I don't want to break friendship over this bullshit
04/09/2018, 12:35 - Dikshita Kothari: She only heard what she wanted and left what can I do
04/09/2018, 12:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Damn sad
04/09/2018, 12:36 - Jenit Jain: It's fine. We don't want nethraa. Or agrim. Why does he think he's talking from everyone's sidr
04/09/2018, 12:36 - Jenit Jain: What did you reply
04/09/2018, 12:39 - Dikshita Kothari: I never would've thought in my wildest dreams that she would be able to break a two year long friendship so easily
04/09/2018, 12:39 - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't replied anything
04/09/2018, 12:39 - Jenit Jain: Don't reply
04/09/2018, 12:40 - Jenit Jain: Why do you care
04/09/2018, 12:40 - Jenit Jain: It shouldn't matter

25/09/2018, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: 🧡💙
25/09/2018, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't like what you did today jenit it was very wrong. I apologized immediately. It was force of habit and you knew that. You knew it meant nothing. What I did, I did by mistake and I said sorry immediately. But what you did was out of spite and that's not nice at all. I really don't need shit from you as well. You know it's already hard why'd you make it harder. 
And I'm your gf so my rep is also yours what was the point of telling everyone what I did. I really don't need to be judged by more people. I understand you felt bad, anyone would. But then you tell me and we talk about it don't go and tell the entire world about stupid tiffs we have. It's not fair. You said you didn't even feel that bad. That's just sadistic to put me through something that is just completely unnecessary.
25/09/2018, 00:54 - Jenit Jain: I said it because its a very funny thing to say
25/09/2018, 00:54 - Jenit Jain: And like it is a famous mistake kind of thing

19/10/2018, 17:05 - Dikshita Kothari: I think if she got back with Siddarth he would've told her that if you continue to talk to jenit then we can't be together

09/11/2018, 12:15 - Dikshita Kothari: So I was in Mumbai okay
09/11/2018, 12:15 - Dikshita Kothari: And big sirens went off
09/11/2018, 12:15 - Dikshita Kothari: So we all knew that it was time for the apocalypse
09/11/2018, 12:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause too much pollution
09/11/2018, 12:16 - Dikshita Kothari: We knew that a huge tsunami was going to come from the moon
09/11/2018, 12:16 - Dikshita Kothari: Like the wave was legit going to come from the moon
09/11/2018, 12:16 - Dikshita Kothari: So mom dad vidushi and I
09/11/2018, 12:16 - Jenit Jain: You really wanna destroy mumbai
09/11/2018, 12:17 - Dikshita Kothari: Wait Jen
09/11/2018, 12:17 - Dikshita Kothari: Then
09/11/2018, 12:17 - Dikshita Kothari: We went to a balcony of a building and we were going to hold our breath till the wave goes away
09/11/2018, 12:18 - Dikshita Kothari: So what happened was that when the wave hit
09/11/2018, 12:18 - Dikshita Kothari: Somehow there was a bubble around us and we could all breathe
09/11/2018, 12:18 - Dikshita Kothari: Mom was getting very jumpy but she could also breathe
09/11/2018, 12:19 - Dikshita Kothari: The tsunami lasted 15 minutes and after everything was over
09/11/2018, 12:19 - Dikshita Kothari: When we came out of the bubble
09/11/2018, 12:19 - Dikshita Kothari: The whole city was still there
09/11/2018, 12:19 - Jenit Jain: All that ends well is well
09/11/2018, 12:19 - Jenit Jain: Woohoo

09/11/2018, 12:20 - Dikshita Kothari: It's not over
09/11/2018, 12:20 - Dikshita Kothari: But everything was completely beautiful
09/11/2018, 12:20 - Dikshita Kothari: The buildings were now shorter in height and all
09/11/2018, 12:20 - Dikshita Kothari: Like more beautifully arranged
09/11/2018, 12:21 - Dikshita Kothari: There were fewer people
09/11/2018, 12:21 - Dikshita Kothari: So only the worthy had survived the storm
09/11/2018, 12:21 - Dikshita Kothari: And the empty spaces had been filled with the most beautiful flowers
09/11/2018, 12:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Purple blue and pink
09/11/2018, 12:21 - Dikshita Kothari: It was dark when it was done
09/11/2018, 12:22 - Dikshita Kothari: So those flowers we found out were bioluminescent
09/11/2018, 12:22 - Dikshita Kothari: They were glowing
09/11/2018, 12:22 - Dikshita Kothari: So we took a car and we started driving
09/11/2018, 12:22 - Dikshita Kothari: Somehow there was a mountain in Mumbai
09/11/2018, 12:22 - Dikshita Kothari: And snow capped that too
09/11/2018, 12:23 - Dikshita Kothari: And a huge moon stone hit that mountain and caused an avalanche
09/11/2018, 12:23 - Dikshita Kothari: We were in a car so we just drove away
09/11/2018, 12:23 - Dikshita Kothari: But the avalanche destroyed the city
09/11/2018, 12:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Again only the worthy were saved
09/11/2018, 12:23 - Dikshita Kothari: While we were driving
09/11/2018, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: We saw weird nature beautiful things
09/11/2018, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: Like a seal was giving birth to two baby seals
09/11/2018, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: And I got completely shook
09/11/2018, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: I was like what are we doing to our earth
09/11/2018, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: We have to save it
09/11/2018, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: I started thinking about why god thought I was worthy and saved me
09/11/2018, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe cause I am going to make something that is going to redeem us all
09/11/2018, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: So because of me
09/11/2018, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: He hadn't killed any of my friends either
09/11/2018, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: All my close family and all were there
09/11/2018, 12:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause no genius can work without being emotionally stable
09/11/2018, 12:26 - Dikshita Kothari: So I went and made something very cool
09/11/2018, 12:26 - Dikshita Kothari: But I forgot what that was and my dream finished

24/11/2018, 02:25 - Dikshita Kothari: All the details over various confirmed sources we're put together. 
And the entire scene yesterday was found out chronologically,  most rumours that are spreading are because of misinformation and I'm hoping to resolve at least some of those. 
If you disagree with me or think some fact is wrong,  I'm sorry about that but this is what I believe and you are we come to your own belief. 


1. The original incident occurred at 2:30-3:00 and when first reported,  it wasn't taken seriously.  The girl was told to write a letter about what happened and explain the details. But by this time the culprit had left the campus and gotten away. 

2. The girl and 2 of her brothers from college,  followed  the culprit to Mahindra City but he was able to get away.  Hearing about this and worried for their safety,  a group of 2nd-4th years went behind them to Mahindra City. 

3. The next occurrence was that the hostel girls started gathering at about 7:00 PM.  At this time the Registrar had arrived and tried handling it in a proper manner, however this failed and people started gathering around the registrar and shouting. There had been no North-South comment *at this time * by the Registrar. 
The North South comment was made by the wardens, whose details were noted by everyone including name and the students were informed that they would not be there ever again and specific action will be taken against them.

4. The registrar who wanted to help was intimidated or worried by people's response and left. The girl's hostel gates were closed around 8:00-8:30.  Girls started climbing over the walls in an attempt to stop the registrar, but he was scared and left. 

5. The original girl's complaint was being pushed away, so everyone went instead to the house of the Director of Campus Life, who is the old man that went through the crowd. They gathered near his house and wanted to talk in a rational manner.  However this was proving unsuccessful due to the mass of the crowd,  thus a suggestion was made that everyone should go to the auditorium and talk it out peacefully. 

6.At this point the main gate guards moved into campus to help get the Director to the auditorium. This left the main gates unmanned and allowed outsiders who found out about the scene to enter and cause extra chaos for their own benefit.  
The original victim girl was still at the Director's house so they could get to the auditorium slowly and not get stuck in between the crowd. 

7. The Director moving from the girl's hostel to the auditorium is the scene that most people are aware of and while moving he was constantly surrounded by people and the whole crowd was heaving from random sides due to the right spacing. 
The Director was at this point annoyed and asked why the students were attacking him and that he was not in the ultimate authority and just wants to help.

8.The crowd kept pushing and becoming restless and an incident occured where people tried hitting him. The seniors tried protecting him and because he was old and they also wanted this to be handled in a civil matter as that was the only way they could be assured of a solution. 

9. At this point the Director started abusing, and made the comment regarding “why do you wear short clothes” and other things, thus enraging the crowd. The close circle around said Director knew what was happening and most of the peripheral mass had no idea of the details. Thus the presence of the crowd was not helping and anyone on site knows how it was just chaos and pushing. 

10. The crowd was chanting and wanted immediate justice such as bringing the culprit and demanding action be taken on spot. This was however an unreasonable request from someone who had no power over it. 

11. The director took shelter in a security room near the hospital where he made the North South comment due to fatigue.
The security room was attacked after this and the window glass was broken as people tried to enter. 
The students keeping him safe found a way to slowly escort him till the M block through a back entrance.

12. The Director of Student Affairs (DSA head)  made an appearance and entered the college from the front entry along with the SRO, wardens and security guards.  She waited and listened to all the complaints not just the original victim's. She got mad for some reason at one point and so did the group of girls talking to her. 

13. The Director told the victim to file the FIR And get it done with and to write it in her own words- the girl had as of then not written the FIR yet due to her personal reasons. Maybe because she wanted to wait for her parents, the actual reason is unconfirmed. The director asked her to file an FIR and it has been filed now. Proof of this will be presented soon. They don't have a copy available right now. 

14. It was said that precautions will be taken from then onwards so that such an instance does not occur again and the only way to prove it would be to wait and see if they actually follow up in the future. 
The girl herself has currently filed an FIR and while she may not be happy with how long it took and how it was done, she understands that the college is backing her and is okay with the position. 

Official news report-
The report that was said correlating the exam postponement and the girl's case was taken by an NDTV reporter who was outside campus at the gate and could not enter.  They received all their information from students leaving the college, students who had shown up to see what is happening, heard scarce details from others and were now leaving all of whom were 100% boys and lacked actual data. Along with them, the security guards at the gates who were completely unaware about what was happening provided the reporter their data.  As far as the guards were concerned, earlier the same day a protest was made due to the exams and to postpone them and after that about the girl's issue. The reporter heard all this and scourged up a story from what they could piece together.

27/11/2018, 10:43 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't think you can
27/11/2018, 10:44 - Dikshita Kothari: I think you should get the minor in AI
27/11/2018, 10:44 - Dikshita Kothari: That's what you want to do right
27/11/2018, 10:44 - Dikshita Kothari: You have to look at it from an overall perspective
27/11/2018, 10:44 - Dikshita Kothari: Not just cause you'll be missing classes
27/11/2018, 10:45 - Dikshita Kothari: How come after so much interest in AI you're planning to change it suddenly
27/11/2018, 10:45 - Dikshita Kothari: 10 days is not that much tbh
27/11/2018, 10:45 - Dikshita Kothari: You're writing gre in December why you need more time for that?
27/11/2018, 10:45 - Jenit Jain: Yeah but then Ill have proper classes for it and plus oe is technical cause I can't do non technical

27/11/2018, 10:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Otherwise you'll just be studying 4 whole subjects that you have no connection to with your interest
27/11/2018, 10:53 - Jenit Jain: That's not compulsory
27/11/2018, 10:53 - Jenit Jain: Project ka things are there in 7th seem da

02/12/2018, 11:53 - Dikshita Kothari: So then angiography is a minimally invasive procedure
02/12/2018, 11:54 - Dikshita Kothari: In which they put stent so that the artery remains distended and doesn't collapse and block the path of the blood
02/12/2018, 11:54 - Jenit Jain: Permanent?

15/12/2018, 21:39 - Jenit Jain: You just have 6 seconds extra per question than you thought
15/12/2018, 21:39 - Jenit Jain: Lol

15/12/2018, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need that time for anything apart from rc
15/12/2018, 21:42 - Jenit Jain: Dad said at least 5 years more for a new house and then gave an emotional speech about how people around me are doing worse and now I just don't care anymore
15/12/2018, 21:42 - Jenit Jain: I'm not moving home after engineering till they shift
15/12/2018, 21:43 - Dikshita Kothari: You are leaning towards not moving home at all Jen
15/12/2018, 21:43 - Dikshita Kothari: Thoda think babu

15/12/2018, 21:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Mom came
15/12/2018, 21:45 - Dikshita Kothari: I'll call you back
15/12/2018, 21:45 - Dikshita Kothari: But network is bad
15/12/2018, 21:46 - Jenit Jain: Okay
15/12/2018, 21:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Tell wassup
15/12/2018, 21:46 - Jenit Jain: No idc anymore
15/12/2018, 21:46 - Jenit Jain: He said rn toh shaddi is there so obviously we cant make big expenditure now.
15/12/2018, 21:47 - Jenit Jain: And later hes like if the building is ready and then he can think because he doesn't wanna stay on rent for more than a year (like when we sell my current house and wait for the new one to get made)
15/12/2018, 21:47 - Jenit Jain: And again, same bullshit that real estate is very down and all
15/12/2018, 21:48 - Jenit Jain: And then he's like I won't take a loan because it's a vicious cycle
15/12/2018, 21:49 - Jenit Jain: And that accumulating the money for new house without selling the current one will take time because there's a recession going on
15/12/2018, 21:49 - Jenit Jain: Then I was like then try finding options to try to relieve the business burden by branching out and then he just gave me examples of my cousins who tried branching out and got fucked
15/12/2018, 21:50 - Jenit Jain: So basically his idea behind alleviating the business problem is just to wait and hope for the best
15/12/2018, 21:50 - Jenit Jain: And when I told him he has to do something about it he just said that all the businesses are facing this problemn
15/12/2018, 21:50 - Jenit Jain: Then I just gave up
15/12/2018, 21:50 - Jenit Jain: I'm done dude.
15/12/2018, 21:50 - Jenit Jain: I don't like my home

21/12/2018, 20:30 - Dikshita Kothari: 💛🧡💫
21/12/2018, 20:30 - Jenit Jain: I'm not giving you advice only
21/12/2018, 20:30 - Dikshita Kothari: You only said
21/12/2018, 20:31 - Jenit Jain: Aap overwhelm karoge
21/12/2018, 20:31 - Dikshita Kothari: Do rc
21/12/2018, 20:32 - Jenit Jain: I said that you revise all 1000 words you know today. Then over the course of the next 10 days you learn total 500 words. Since you'll be learning fewer new words everyday you'll get to do rc, and the words you don't know in that you can look up
21/12/2018, 20:32 - Jenit Jain: So you are getting both knowledge and practice in lesser time and lesser strain
21/12/2018, 20:32 - Dikshita Kothari: Today and tomorrow mein I'll finish it na
21/12/2018, 20:32 - Dikshita Kothari: What's the problem

21/12/2018, 20:50 - Jenit Jain: You're not giving up
21/12/2018, 20:51 - Jenit Jain: You'll be allocating your time more efficiently which will lead to a better performance
21/12/2018, 20:51 - Jenit Jain: This can jeopardize your performance you know
21/12/2018, 20:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Encourage always
21/12/2018, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: I'm realistic and you have time. BUT you do seem confident about remembering all the words and then doing rc. So do everything tonight. I'll stay awake with you till late
21/12/2018, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: Cool?
21/12/2018, 21:16 - Dikshita Kothari: Yayyy

21/12/2018, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: You love stationery anyway
21/12/2018, 21:32 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
21/12/2018, 21:46 - Dikshita Kothari: 250 words
21/12/2018, 23:09 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita
21/12/2018, 23:09 - Jenit Jain: So I understood the argumentative
21/12/2018, 23:09 - Jenit Jain: But in the issue one
21/12/2018, 23:10 - Jenit Jain: Do you have to take a side and write about that only
21/12/2018, 23:10 - Jenit Jain: Or you can write about both the sides?
21/12/2018, 23:11 - Jenit Jain: And is it necessary to choose a side
21/12/2018, 23:11 - Dikshita Kothari: You can
21/12/2018, 23:11 - Dikshita Kothari: But if you do
21/12/2018, 23:12 - Dikshita Kothari: You can't get more than 4
21/12/2018, 23:12 - Dikshita Kothari: Explain pls
21/12/2018, 23:12 - Jenit Jain: So in issue you basically just pick a side and give points on why you selected that side right
21/12/2018, 23:13 - Jenit Jain: Basically divide the prompt into conclusion, premises and assumptions
21/12/2018, 23:14 - Jenit Jain: Conclusion is what the prompt is saying
21/12/2018, 23:14 - Jenit Jain: Premise is the reason behind the conclusion
21/12/2018, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: They are explicitly stated in the prompt
21/12/2018, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: And assumptions are unstated reasons behind the conclusion.
21/12/2018, 23:17 - Jenit Jain: So you take these assumptions (which you can just come up with your own since it won't be written in the prompt at all) and write why are they bad assumptions
21/12/2018, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
21/12/2018, 23:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Thanks for typing so much

24/12/2018, 23:52 - Jenit Jain: So obviously everyone noticed because food I eat properly
24/12/2018, 23:52 - Jenit Jain: Then I tried vocab and it wasn't happening so I sleot

24/12/2018, 23:53 - Jenit Jain: And vidit texted that guy and fucked it up even more
24/12/2018, 23:53 - Jenit Jain: Then I felt very defeated
24/12/2018, 23:54 - Jenit Jain: Because if I did report him and if he complained to the college, which he would have, there would be an enquiry
24/12/2018, 23:54 - Jenit Jain: And then my address would also be under the radar
24/12/2018, 23:54 - Jenit Jain: So next semester would be fuckrd

24/12/2018, 23:55 - Jenit Jain: Because I was feeling vengeful and self destructing
24/12/2018, 23:55 - Jenit Jain: Then regretted it
24/12/2018, 23:56 - Jenit Jain: So I emailed angelist to retract my report but still haven't received a reply
24/12/2018, 23:56 - Jenit Jain: Then I got the Photoshop thing done which is fine
24/12/2018, 23:56 - Jenit Jain: Then rishab se I was talking and he is too obsessed with Arusha thing
24/12/2018, 23:56 - Jenit Jain: So it irritated me
24/12/2018, 23:57 - Dikshita Kothari: Aiyo
24/12/2018, 23:57 - Jenit Jain: So then I told him that I know that he hasn't corrected himself, remember when he spoke for me to somiya, about the comment thing. I told him to tell her I wasn't kidding
24/12/2018, 23:57 - Jenit Jain: Which he said he did but I know he didn't
24/12/2018, 23:57 - Jenit Jain: So I forced him to text her

24/12/2018, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: So rishab started saying you need to stop making me your middle man
24/12/2018, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: My image is getting ruined
24/12/2018, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: So i said that it's your fault
24/12/2018, 23:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
24/12/2018, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: And you're correcting your mistake
24/12/2018, 23:59 - Jenit Jain: So he said yeah fine. Whatever
24/12/2018, 23:59 - Jenit Jain: Then I finished vocab
24/12/2018, 23:59 - Jenit Jain: Then dinner was bad af

25/12/2018, 00:00 - Dikshita Kothari: Aiyo

25/12/2018, 00:00 - Jenit Jain: Because blackout
25/12/2018, 00:00 - Jenit Jain: The defeated feeling is still there
25/12/2018, 00:01 - Jenit Jain: Then my school people called so I was like haan I'll go and smoke and forget today
25/12/2018, 00:01 - Jenit Jain: So i went
25/12/2018, 00:01 - Jenit Jain: And it was actually relaxing
25/12/2018, 00:01 - Jenit Jain: Then while coming back, my friend fucked up driving
25/12/2018, 00:01 - Jenit Jain: She was supposed to wait for vehicles to pass before taking the right turn
25/12/2018, 00:02 - Jenit Jain: But instead she speeded to surpass

[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: His point is that in his friend groups are all cool and studs and they find sex and all cool and shit
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: He can’t afford to say that he is a virgin
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: I’m toooo disgusted
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Chi that's damn sycophant type
[22/01, 1:08 AM] Pranu USA: Ikr
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: And i don’t lie about it so I say if anyone asks me that no and all
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: So he isn’t okay w it because it’s affecting his reputation
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: I don’t know how to react
[22/01, 1:09 AM] Pranu USA: I can’t believe he thinks this way
[22/01, 2:30 AM] Pranu USA: Jenit has asked you to explain “complex and real” to give me perspective hehe😂
[22/01, 7:56 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Okkk
[22/01, 7:57 AM] Dikshita Kothari: He forgot you're a commerce student
[22/01, 7:57 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Okayy
[22/01, 7:57 AM] Dikshita Kothari: No problem
[22/01, 8:06 AM] Dikshita Kothari: So current in any resistor is divided into two parts complex and real as in a+ib 
The real part of current = a 
The complex part of current = b 
Only the real part adds to the power of the resistor while the complex part reduces it. Real part is constant while complex is variable. 
Imagine you're the resistor. 
Each person in your life can and should be divided into two sections. Complex and real. 
Anyone who contributes to your life in any way and adds to you as an individual is a real person. Anyone who adds to your problems is complex. You should keep the real people carefully and not pay attention to the complex components. Or the real people are your "friends" and the complex people are your "colleagues". 
Not only people this is applicable to everything in your life. Anything fixed is real and anything variable is complex. 
Each night before you sleep you have to make a list. Three things that are real and three things that are complex. 
For example: You can think of pizza as real and a pimple as complex. 
Pin the real components in your life and know how they contribute to you. The complex components are just holding you back as an individual, they're temporary and should be removed.
[22/01, 10:58 AM] Pranu USA: I’m shook
[22/01, 10:59 AM] Pranu USA: What an amazing perspective
[22/01, 10:59 AM] Pranu USA: Killed it

[22/01, 10:59 AM] Pranu USA: You thought of thissss?
[22/01, 11:03 AM] Dikshita Kothari: Yas
[22/01, 11:03 AM] Dikshita Kothari: I was very drunk when I thought of this
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: It’s tooo lit
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: You won’t believe
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: Anuvrat is saying that to those people who he has already said he has had sex and if he can’t take my name, he will take someone else’s
[22/01, 11:04 AM] Pranu USA: You have no idea what’s going through me right now
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Pranu USA: I feel like slapping him so hard that he can never speak again
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Dikshita Kothari: You should
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Pranu USA: He can break a relationship but not say “ I was just messing/joking around but really haven’t “”
[22/01, 11:05 AM] Pranu USA: He has to take a name
[22/01, 11:06 AM] Pranu USA: Even if one lets this go, the mentality only is completely wrong
22/01/2019, 11:08 - Jenit Jain: Babu
22/01/2019, 11:08 - Jenit Jain: I spoke to her acchese last night

22/01/2019, 20:25 - Dikshita Kothari: That was your own undoing
22/01/2019, 20:25 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you not to be mean to Rishabh
22/01/2019, 20:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Soniya toh what do I even say

22/01/2019, 20:26 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm saying it's nicer to have someone to talk to than to not talk to anyone at all

22/01/2019, 20:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want to be the person in the corner who doesn't talk to anyone
22/01/2019, 20:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I've already done that
22/01/2019, 20:28 - Dikshita Kothari: And I was miserable
22/01/2019, 20:28 - Dikshita Kothari: You cannot oppress your opinion on me

22/01/2019, 20:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Then stop repeating it
22/01/2019, 20:30 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I didn't have charge on my phone
22/01/2019, 20:30 - Dikshita Kothari: But I am not sorry about anything else
22/01/2019, 20:30 - Dikshita Kothari: And dare you everrrr bitch about me to someone else Jen
22/01/2019, 20:30 - Dikshita Kothari: If you have a problem

22/01/2019, 20:31 - Dikshita Kothari: It's definitely not okay for you to tell some random psycho
22/01/2019, 20:31 - Jenit Jain: I didn't bitch about you. Just your friends
22/01/2019, 20:31 - Jenit Jain: I have bitched to you too

22/01/2019, 20:32 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya cause I didn't have a problem with it
22/01/2019, 20:32 - Jenit Jain: Everyone asked me separately that is your gf coming to the wedding
22/01/2019, 20:33 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to meddle in my college stuff
22/01/2019, 20:33 - Jenit Jain: Duh
22/01/2019, 20:33 - Dikshita Kothari: How are you okay with it
22/01/2019, 20:33 - Dikshita Kothari: You're okay with being friends with me
22/01/2019, 20:33 - Dikshita Kothari: Her *
22/01/2019, 20:33 - Jenit Jain: IDK how to respond to thus
22/01/2019, 20:33 - Dikshita Kothari: But you have a problem with me being friends with people who are none of these things
22/01/2019, 20:34 - Jenit Jain: She's not like that with me. And I know how to pull her strings to bring her in her aukad
22/01/2019, 20:34 - Dikshita Kothari: You shouldn't have to do that
22/01/2019, 20:34 - Dikshita Kothari: And by that I know you mean insulting
22/01/2019, 20:35 - Jenit Jain: Your friends are so inexperienced with social things that it makes me uncomfortable when they are around you
22/01/2019, 20:35 - Jenit Jain: No
22/01/2019, 20:35 - Jenit Jain: I don't insult
22/01/2019, 20:36 - Jenit Jain: I just bring up things from the past that show her true character and then she's like ya na man sorry na whatever
22/01/2019, 20:36 - Dikshita Kothari: So am iiiiu
22/01/2019, 20:36 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm from a girl's schooollll

22/01/2019, 20:37 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay good then
22/01/2019, 20:38 - Jenit Jain: Dude it's been 2.5 years. You've changed. They are still like Bhai ladki se kaise baat karte hai
22/01/2019, 20:38 - Jenit Jain: And not because they are introvert
22/01/2019, 20:39 - Jenit Jain: Just remember that every second you're with them I'm feeling uncomfortable.
22/01/2019, 20:39 - Jenit Jain: Now go I won't meddle with your college
22/01/2019, 20:41 - Jenit Jain: And you probably don't want me around your friends because all Im gonna do is just show them their true character.
22/01/2019, 20:41 - Jenit Jain: Except like your showstopper ones
22/01/2019, 20:41 - Jenit Jain: They are chill
22/01/2019, 20:48 - Dikshita Kothari: The day you stop doing weed I'll stop hanging with my class people
22/01/2019, 20:48 - Jenit Jain: Wow okay

22/01/2019, 20:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe you should think about that
22/01/2019, 20:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Instead of wasting time with my class friends
22/01/2019, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: The conclusion is based in a false pretense as it is not supported by arguments
Weed is non addictive

22/01/2019, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: 6/6
22/01/2019, 20:59 - Jenit Jain: Tbh i know I'm obsessed with hating your friends it truly is a bad waste of time. Moreover it's not even like I'm possessive which I'm glad about. But my only reason for it is me being concerned about your safety
22/01/2019, 21:07 - Jenit Jain: It's annoying that you bring up pot only when you want an argument is going on.
22/01/2019, 21:07 - Jenit Jain: Last sem after you said I decreased also

27/01/2019, 00:43 - Dikshita Kothari: No I really know it
27/01/2019, 00:43 - Jenit Jain: Just because sriya understood the gravity of the situation after I texted her doesn't mean something in uour head clicked
27/01/2019, 00:43 - Dikshita Kothari: Pakka

27/01/2019, 00:45 - Jenit Jain: Then text me when you "really" know it.
27/01/2019, 00:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Nooo I know it
27/01/2019, 00:45 - Jenit Jain: All these are bs excuses that I don't have time for
27/01/2019, 00:45 - Jenit Jain: I'm not even kidding rn.
27/01/2019, 00:45 - Dikshita Kothari: I just don't care enough to make it such a big thing
27/01/2019, 00:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Complex
27/01/2019, 00:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Af
27/01/2019, 00:46 - Jenit Jain: My girlfriend getting insulted and then acting stupid enough to go back is the biggest concern for me.
27/01/2019, 00:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre I don't care baba
27/01/2019, 00:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Really
27/01/2019, 00:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Let them think what they want
27/01/2019, 00:47 - Dikshita Kothari: I really just wanted to play stock exchange I swear
27/01/2019, 00:47 - Dikshita Kothari: You know na
27/01/2019, 00:47 - Jenit Jain: You are to completely ignore their existence hence forth. Please text me when you "really" understand why I want you to do that. When it comes to nethraa, since she's a girl, I'll leave it up to you.
27/01/2019, 00:47 - Dikshita Kothari: I really didn't care
27/01/2019, 00:47 - Jenit Jain: My best friends were across the hall
27/01/2019, 00:48 - Jenit Jain: Seeing as they are your friends and the 414 aren't even friends of yours I know what I would have selected if I was in your shoes.
27/01/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: I really understand I swear
27/01/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: No no I knocked to say hi
27/01/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Obviously
27/01/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: No one was there
27/01/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: They would've gone somewhere
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I just find it easier to forget what happened and talk to 414
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I rang the bell
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I swear
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Jenit Jain: You just keep proving me right about your stupidity
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I won't lie to you
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not stupid
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: My aim today was to have fun
27/01/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: If I could put it past me
27/01/2019, 00:50 - Dikshita Kothari: And have fun
27/01/2019, 00:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Then I'm not stupid
27/01/2019, 00:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause I got what I wabted
27/01/2019, 00:50 - Jenit Jain: When you understand this text me in fb, I'll unblock you. Because rn, I really don't wanna talk to dikshita that does such reckless and self demeaning things. My actual dikshita is much smarter than that.
27/01/2019, 00:50 - Jenit Jain: Goodnight
27/01/2019, 01:04 - Jenit Jain: Did
27/01/2019, 01:04 - Jenit Jain: But please don't talk to me until you understand the gravity of the situation
27/01/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
27/01/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: I understood
27/01/2019, 01:05 - Dikshita Kothari: But do you understand the gravity of my situation?
27/01/2019, 01:05 - Dikshita Kothari: No
27/01/2019, 01:05 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even give me a solution
27/01/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: A
27/01/2019, 01:05 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even understand that I feel really sad
27/01/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: Where was divya
27/01/2019, 01:05 - Dikshita Kothari: With her mom

27/01/2019, 01:06 - Dikshita Kothari: With her class mates
27/01/2019, 01:06 - Jenit Jain: Seeing that you went for less than 2 hours, you could have e easily watches Brooklyn 99

27/01/2019, 01:07 - Jenit Jain: But yeah those could have been other options
27/01/2019, 01:07 - Dikshita Kothari: Tell something involving people

27/01/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: And she wanted to play with them
27/01/2019, 01:09 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't suggest to go and spend time with them
27/01/2019, 01:09 - Dikshita Kothari: She did
27/01/2019, 01:09 - Jenit Jain: Accha okay I understand, so since you don't have friends since they are out you replace them with molesters and fuck off wale peeps
27/01/2019, 01:09 - Jenit Jain: Okay

27/01/2019, 19:31 - Dikshita Kothari: Good should be
27/01/2019, 19:31 - Dikshita Kothari: Hey Dikshita, I'm not completely woke about all the things that have been happening but I thought that parth, you and I were always as we were last night. I thought it was just the lack of opportunities to meet up, that we didn't hang out as much. I apologise if it felt like we didn't support you in the whole anirudh business. But we did, when we met him we talked about it, I mean I felt that he has to at least apologise and try to make up. I admit that I don't have answers for a lot of things.
More importantly, I am sorry if this offends you, but I just need to know. 
Jenit texted parth and told him and me to "stay away" from his "girlfriend" , normally I would ignore it. But you have spoken through him in the past and I just want to confirm if he is speaking for you this time too.
27/01/2019, 19:32 - Jenit Jain: Tell him it's all me
27/01/2019, 19:34 - Jenit Jain: And comment about sriyas screenshots. That if 20 isn't old enough to know what's molestation and what's not then you legally belong behind the bars.
27/01/2019, 19:34 - Jenit Jain: This is your only turn to keep your firm standn
27/01/2019, 19:34 - Jenit Jain: Don't fuck it up by being diplomatic
27/01/2019, 19:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Aiyo

27/01/2019, 19:35 - Jenit Jain: Give his number
27/01/2019, 19:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't drag me into this
27/01/2019, 19:35 - Jenit Jain: I'll be as polite as possible
27/01/2019, 19:35 - Jenit Jain: I promise
27/01/2019, 19:35 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want to get involved
27/01/2019, 19:35 - Jenit Jain: Fair enough

27/01/2019, 21:26 - Dikshita Kothari: You just text him saying
27/01/2019, 21:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Dikshita doesn't have the courage or the heart to say that you suck
27/01/2019, 21:27 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't cry Jen
27/01/2019, 21:27 - Dikshita Kothari: I'll do what you say
27/01/2019, 21:27 - Dikshita Kothari: She's not that strong and she's never going to be
27/01/2019, 21:27 - Jenit Jain: Tell me what have I done to you that you're going telling 3rd people that oh whatever jenit is saying fuck that. You listen to me. That also after saying you talk to him I don't wanna be involved
27/01/2019, 21:27 - Jenit Jain: If you didn't wanna be then you would have kept your phone side mao
27/01/2019, 21:27 - Dikshita Kothari: He texted me I didn't know what to do
27/01/2019, 21:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I thought I should say something to diffuse the situation
27/01/2019, 21:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't know okay

27/01/2019, 21:29 - Jenit Jain: This is also one of my problems.
27/01/2019, 21:29 - Jenit Jain: It's just that you're too stubborn and stupid to see it.
27/01/2019, 21:29 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't carry grudges throughout my life
27/01/2019, 21:29 - Dikshita Kothari: You saw na

27/01/2019, 21:31 - Dikshita Kothari: This is not about you Jen
27/01/2019, 21:31 - Jenit Jain: Girls I can't say anything because they are your only block friends.
27/01/2019, 21:31 - Jenit Jain: Honestly I will be very fake to Divya also from now
27/01/2019, 21:31 - Dikshita Kothari: All my friends are bad then toh according to you
27/01/2019, 21:31 - Jenit Jain: Upaasana I never cared also
27/01/2019, 21:31 - Jenit Jain: Not according to me.
27/01/2019, 21:32 - Dikshita Kothari: Haan exactly Divya ne kya bola pata hai na aapko
27/01/2019, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: According to any sane person
27/01/2019, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: No

27/01/2019, 21:34 - Jenit Jain: Don't say that I got over it then
27/01/2019, 21:34 - Jenit Jain: You're being self contradictory
27/01/2019, 21:34 - Dikshita Kothari: No no
27/01/2019, 21:34 - Dikshita Kothari: I have been through this in the last semester itself
27/01/2019, 21:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Now I know to keep my expectations low
27/01/2019, 21:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't break my friendship with Divya jenn
27/01/2019, 21:35 - Dikshita Kothari: I know one person is enough

27/01/2019, 21:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't be
27/01/2019, 21:36 - Dikshita Kothari: No need
27/01/2019, 21:36 - Jenit Jain: So that your friendship is intact.
27/01/2019, 21:37 - Dikshita Kothari: Jen
27/01/2019, 21:37 - Dikshita Kothari: People make mistakes
27/01/2019, 21:37 - Dikshita Kothari: No one is perfect babu
27/01/2019, 21:37 - Jenit Jain: I know. The way you embarrassed me today was surely a mistake
27/01/2019, 21:37 - Dikshita Kothari: They all made the same mistake
27/01/2019, 21:37 - Jenit Jain: Let's hope you learn
27/01/2019, 21:38 - Dikshita Kothari: You should not have involved everyone. I told you this yesterday itself. I told you that you were embarrassing me. That you were hurting me but nothing
27/01/2019, 21:38 - Dikshita Kothari: No mercy
27/01/2019, 21:38 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't stop at all

27/01/2019, 21:40 - Dikshita Kothari: No you can't do that
27/01/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: You were the victim

27/01/2019, 21:40 - Dikshita Kothari: No Jen
27/01/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: Kisi ka baap nahi rok sakta hai
27/01/2019, 21:40 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm right and I know it
27/01/2019, 21:40 - Dikshita Kothari: You should've spoken to me
27/01/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: What stuff
27/01/2019, 21:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Before involving them
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: As in you can't make me not feel embarrassed when I do
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Jenit Jain: Accha.
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Jenit Jain: But Divya se I'm talking now
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Jenit Jain: On gossip only
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Jenit Jain: You better hold your texting.
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't kick me out
27/01/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
27/01/2019, 21:43 - Dikshita Kothari: You should talk to Pranu about this
27/01/2019, 21:43 - Dikshita Kothari: Not these guys
27/01/2019, 21:43 - Dikshita Kothari: She doesn't know anything
27/01/2019, 21:43 - Dikshita Kothari: So you will have to tell her from the start
27/01/2019, 21:43 - Dikshita Kothari: Leave Divya Jen
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Dikshita Kothari: She doesn't have an opinion
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Jenit Jain: What will we hey out of that
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Jenit Jain: Let her say it out explicitly.
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Dikshita Kothari: You will get satisfaction
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Dikshita Kothari: Why
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Jenit Jain: I don't know anything about divyas opinion
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you na
27/01/2019, 21:44 - Dikshita Kothari: She doesn't
27/01/2019, 21:45 - Dikshita Kothari: I just spoke to jenit. 

Most of everything that happened was my fault so, I'm sorry. I didn't know I was ignoring so many things especially, your prespective. And I'm sorry for that too. There isn't really anything that I can do to fix anything, I just felt like apologising, so that's what I'm doing. I guess we won't be meeting much after this, yesterday was a lot of fun and thanks for the Brownies.  Will miss playing board games.
27/01/2019, 21:45 - Jenit Jain: That she'll say that yes dikshita shouldnt have gone to 414?
27/01/2019, 21:45 - Dikshita Kothari: She will say what useless friends
27/01/2019, 21:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Then both of you can establish that all my friends are horrible
27/01/2019, 21:47 - Dikshita Kothari: Who are you talking to
27/01/2019, 21:47 - Jenit Jain: Sahil
27/01/2019, 21:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Huh
27/01/2019, 21:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Why
27/01/2019, 21:49 - Jenit Jain: That will give me satisfaction but my point her is to get your justice and to (forcefully till the point that you wanna break up with me) keep you away from the people who have wronged you. You are a stupid child who goes to wrong things, it is literally job as a boyfriend (father away from home) to keep you guarded.
27/01/2019, 21:50 - Jenit Jain: Theres not a single soul who can stop me from doing that hence I shall cross all boundaries to make sure you are safe and guarded.
27/01/2019, 21:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I'll be safe but damn lonely Jen
27/01/2019, 21:50 - Jenit Jain: Much better than to hang out with snakes.
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Last semester you only told me go talk go talk
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Jenit Jain: You chill with your class ones without booze and the girls I won't say anything because then you'll be in safe zone.
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Dikshita Kothari: This semester
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Jenit Jain: To whom
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Dikshita Kothari: You're like don't hang out
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Girls
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Jenit Jain: Nooooo
27/01/2019, 21:51 - Jenit Jain: Never
27/01/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: I meant I won't be trusting any of them except sriya
27/01/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: You're free to do what you want with the girls.
27/01/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: Divya, I want her to say that she didn't do shit
27/01/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: Then I'll remove the fake me
27/01/2019, 21:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
27/01/2019, 21:52 - Dikshita Kothari: If I say don't do it will you listen
27/01/2019, 21:53 - Jenit Jain: Confront her?
27/01/2019, 21:53 - Dikshita Kothari: You shouldn't break friendships like this Jen
27/01/2019, 21:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I've worked very hard to build them
27/01/2019, 21:53 - Jenit Jain: Tu nanga hi toh aaya hai Kya ghanta leke jayega
27/01/2019, 21:54 - Dikshita Kothari: What
27/01/2019, 21:54 - Jenit Jain: How is it affecting your friendship with her
27/01/2019, 21:54 - Jenit Jain: I won't even shout

27/01/2019, 21:57 - Jenit Jain: You should give my friends a shot. 
Gfs very easily join groups, they already think you're an angel, most of all they might decrease smoking up because of you.
27/01/2019, 21:57 - Dikshita Kothari: All bad
27/01/2019, 21:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Or I just get over what they did

27/01/2019, 21:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Everyone deserves a second chance Jen
27/01/2019, 21:58 - Dikshita Kothari: I gave you three chances in second sem

27/01/2019, 21:59 - Dikshita Kothari: Same with these guys
27/01/2019, 21:59 - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe there is something worth waiting for
27/01/2019, 22:00 - Jenit Jain: Second semester was hookup please. But thanks.
27/01/2019, 22:00 - Dikshita Kothari: Han but you were my friend only na

27/01/2019, 22:01 - Dikshita Kothari: But I knew
27/01/2019, 22:01 - Dikshita Kothari: That it's fine
27/01/2019, 22:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause in the end
27/01/2019, 22:01 - Jenit Jain: But for me they are done. Hence I'm telling you to do what you wish with the girls but I need to clear it out.
27/01/2019, 22:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Something nice will happen
27/01/2019, 22:01 - Jenit Jain: I love you
27/01/2019, 22:01 - Jenit Jain: .

27/01/2019, 22:11 - Jenit Jain: Jeez you can't control yourself.
27/01/2019, 22:11 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause you didn't ask my opinion
27/01/2019, 22:11 - Dikshita Kothari: It's the same as everyone else's
27/01/2019, 22:11 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't even attempt to understand my side
27/01/2019, 22:11 - Dikshita Kothari: Every

27/01/2019, 22:32 - Dikshita Kothari: Simply I won't waste my time scolding him
27/01/2019, 22:33 - Jenit Jain: You're not talking only
27/01/2019, 22:33 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay

27/01/2019, 22:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Upach you shouldn't be
27/01/2019, 22:35 - Dikshita Kothari: She says first whenever she feels bad about something someone said
27/01/2019, 22:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Even with Agrim she said
27/01/2019, 22:35 - Dikshita Kothari: And even with Nethraa she said
27/01/2019, 22:35 - Jenit Jain: Fine then only s and p
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Upasana was there in Manipal when the entire Anirudh thing happened
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Dikshita Kothari: I spoke to her and all
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Jenit Jain: What did she sau
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Dikshita Kothari: She's like what an ass
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Dikshita Kothari: But she didn't know what to do after that
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Dikshita Kothari: No one did
27/01/2019, 22:36 - Jenit Jain: Shes a kid. Fair enough
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Dikshita Kothari: For me it's not fair enough ?
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Jenit Jain: Not no one.
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Jenit Jain: Who am I dating
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Jenit Jain: Also dikshita I need to make you understand
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Jenit Jain: We are 1 team
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Jenit Jain: 1
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Jenit Jain: We affect each other
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Dikshita Kothari: No I will make you understand
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm the team leader
27/01/2019, 22:37 - Dikshita Kothari: You have to listen to me
27/01/2019, 22:38 - Dikshita Kothari: If we don't have same views then you have to listen to me
27/01/2019, 22:38 - Jenit Jain: Not in such cases. You don't know half of anything.
27/01/2019, 22:38 - Jenit Jain: Lol no
27/01/2019, 22:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Then we have to come to a conclusion then you can involve other people
27/01/2019, 22:38 - Dikshita Kothari: First at least you should make sure we're on the same ground
27/01/2019, 22:39 - Jenit Jain: And I need you to stop going behind my back and doing things and then telling me oops I did this. I will not tolerate that even one more time. Recently only you did it tons of times. I need to able to blindly trust my gf. Otherwise relationship isn't worth it. So on this front, I'm completely saturated, I don't know what will happen next time you go behind my back.
27/01/2019, 22:40 - Jenit Jain: You are always on the wrong one
27/01/2019, 22:40 - Dikshita Kothari: So you have to talk to me
27/01/2019, 22:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe the wrong one is the right one
27/01/2019, 22:40 - Dikshita Kothari: We will talk about this over pizza
27/01/2019, 22:40 - Jenit Jain: Stfu
27/01/2019, 22:40 - Dikshita Kothari: On Friday
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: What
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Anyways period rahega
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Dikshita Kothari: No you haven't listened at all
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: Did it start
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Dikshita Kothari: This entire argument you only screamed at me
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: Have
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Dikshita Kothari: And didn't listen to what I wanted to say
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Dikshita Kothari: No
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: Bexause you went behind my back.
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Oops
27/01/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: Chup
27/01/2019, 22:42 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't listen to me when I told you to shut up
27/01/2019, 22:42 - Dikshita Kothari: If you don't listen I will also not listen
27/01/2019, 22:42 - Dikshita Kothari: I will fight petty with petty
27/01/2019, 22:43 - Jenit Jain: Whatever the case might be, I will not tolerate you going behind my back ever again. I will not have my trust broken again. On that front, our relationship is not the strongest currently so be careful.
27/01/2019, 22:43 - Jenit Jain: When man.
27/01/2019, 22:43 - Jenit Jain: Yesterday with girls?
27/01/2019, 22:44 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
27/01/2019, 22:45 - Jenit Jain: I've realized that we fight about the same things is because when we initially fight, I always cave in and the issue remains unsolved. And since we fight about very very limited things, thank God, might as well clear it for good
27/01/2019, 22:45 - Jenit Jain: And that's what I did
27/01/2019, 22:45 - Jenit Jain: See again I'm putting you/ our relationship first. I need you to give me equal support
27/01/2019, 22:45 - Jenit Jain: By being honest

27/01/2019, 22:48 - Jenit Jain: Delayed Truth is only so much better than lying dikshita.
27/01/2019, 22:48 - Jenit Jain: Post
27/01/2019, 22:48 - Jenit Jain: Post
27/01/2019, 22:50 - Jenit Jain: I'm tired of the delayed Truth and you acting like a solo player.
27/01/2019, 22:50 - Jenit Jain: Can't deal with these 2
27/01/2019, 22:50 - Jenit Jain: At all
27/01/2019, 22:50 - Jenit Jain: 0 tolerance
27/01/2019, 22:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre then I won't get to play games
27/01/2019, 22:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Solo cause you didn't talk to me before talking to everyone else and so obviously conflict of opinion hoga
27/01/2019, 22:52 - Jenit Jain: I'll play or girls or class people if they don't cut into my time
27/01/2019, 22:53 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay I don't mind
27/01/2019, 22:53 - Jenit Jain: RN saurak thing also
27/01/2019, 22:53 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya
27/01/2019, 22:53 - Dikshita Kothari: You knew I didn't feel the same way
27/01/2019, 22:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you to talk
27/01/2019, 22:53 - Dikshita Kothari: If he texts me I will say what I think is right na
27/01/2019, 22:53 - Dikshita Kothari: How is it my fault
27/01/2019, 22:54 - Jenit Jain: Toh tell me you're texting him so that I can tell the right things or that you can tell the right things. You embarrassed me then
27/01/2019, 22:54 - Jenit Jain: You told be to text them why would you
27/01/2019, 22:55 - Jenit Jain: Team player bano nahi toh baki sab ki tarah single raho
27/01/2019, 22:55 - Jenit Jain: I know what I want
27/01/2019, 22:55 - Jenit Jain: You decide what you want
27/01/2019, 22:57 - Jenit Jain: Whether you like it or not, your life is intertwined with mine, your decisions directly affect me. Abhi insult karna hai toh karlo. But I don't want to be in such a relationship
27/01/2019, 22:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause you didn't listen when I said don't and then I gave up
27/01/2019, 22:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre
27/01/2019, 22:58 - Jenit Jain: Not them, I meant only saurak today
27/01/2019, 22:58 - Dikshita Kothari: You're not understanding me only
27/01/2019, 22:58 - Jenit Jain: I'm not
27/01/2019, 22:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Even I said for Saurak also
27/01/2019, 22:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't give you number in the morning
27/01/2019, 22:59 - Dikshita Kothari: But no
27/01/2019, 22:59 - Dikshita Kothari: You want to text everyone
27/01/2019, 22:59 - Dikshita Kothari: And make the entire thing so public
27/01/2019, 22:59 - Dikshita Kothari: Even I was embarrassed
27/01/2019, 23:00 - Jenit Jain: It would have been less if at least we looked like a team. You spoiled that too but
27/01/2019, 23:00 - Dikshita Kothari: SINCE WHEN THE FUCK HAVE YOU STARTED TO THREATEN ME SAYING THAT YOU DONT WANT TO BE IN THE RELATIONSHIP
27/01/2019, 23:00 - Dikshita Kothari: I was embarrassed before you
27/01/2019, 23:00 - Dikshita Kothari: You disregarded my feelings completely throughout the entire thing
27/01/2019, 23:01 - Jenit Jain: I don't threaten in such things. If I wanted to break up I would have. And the reason I'm bringing breaking up for the first time ever in 3 years is because I never thought you could break my trust so often.
27/01/2019, 23:02 - Jenit Jain: Especially when I'm away
27/01/2019, 23:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Break your trust about what
27/01/2019, 23:02 - Dikshita Kothari: TOLD YOU WHAT I WAS DOING
27/01/2019, 23:02 - Jenit Jain: You're right
27/01/2019, 23:03 - Jenit Jain: Delayed Truth and contradicting me with saurak.
27/01/2019, 23:03 - Dikshita Kothari: That is not break of trust
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Jenit Jain: And I'm sorry for that but I just had to clear everything out because as j said, unsolved issues lead to our recurrent fights.
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Jenit Jain: It is.
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Dikshita Kothari: No it's not
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Dikshita Kothari: I went to play stock exchange
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't go to become chaddi buddies
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Jenit Jain: Embarrassing me in front of others by contradicting me and delayed Truth especially about the things I'm sensitive about
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Contradict nahi kiya Maine
27/01/2019, 23:04 - Dikshita Kothari: My view is different from yours
27/01/2019, 23:05 - Jenit Jain: I said to stay away and you said I want it to be normal.
27/01/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: You embarrassed me first arre ?
27/01/2019, 23:05 - Jenit Jain: Toh you fucking tell me so I can phrase my messages right.
27/01/2019, 23:06 - Jenit Jain: Thanks for the petty revenge then I guess
27/01/2019, 23:06 - Dikshita Kothari: I TOLD YOU, YOU DIDNT LISTEN YOU LEGIT SAID YOUR VIEW IS SHIT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY BHAAV TO IT SO THEN DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES JENIT.
27/01/2019, 23:06 - Dikshita Kothari: No how is your embarassment greater than mine

29/01/2019, 06:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Everyone says this only
29/01/2019, 06:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Ask them how they define leagues next time
29/01/2019, 06:42 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sure their answer will be wrong and stupid
29/01/2019, 06:50 - Dikshita Kothari: There is a phrase that I'm working on eliminating from my vocabulary, and it's one that we all use too frequently. When analyzing the potential compatibility between ourselves and a suitor, oftentimes, the "he's out of my league" excuse comes into play. He (or she) is too tall, too attractive, too smart, too funny, too ambitious or just too plain awesome to be interested in you, right? Wrong. I've come to the realization that no one is truly "out of my league," and here's why.

Let's get this straight: this is no self-serving, pretentious piece proclaiming my alluring charm and dashing good looks. Nope, not at all. I still struggle with my body image issues and self-esteem just like many others do. But I've realized how a iterating simple phrase can become a concept that we really buy into and believe -- we contribute to damaging our self-perception.

The problem is, when we say that someone is "out of our league," we begin believing it. I used to say that guys were out of my league all the time.

"He's too handsome and I'm so average."


"He's hilarious and outgoing; my awkward and goofy sense of humor is no match."

I put myself down despite the other redeeming qualities I have. I viewed my worth as based on how attractive other people thought I was. You can say you don't do this, but you probably do. When we're rejected by someone, we never say, "It must be because I have a really awesome future ahead of me and I'm a really motivated person." No. It's always something along the lines of, "I guess I am not hot enough/fit enough/fun enough/smart enough" for this person's attention.

Even when the situation doesn't apply to ourselves, we apply the method of thinking that people are grouped into leagues. I, too, am guilty of sitting with friends (or hey, even people-watching by myself) and seeing a couple go by with one very attractive partner and one average or "below-average" partner while thinking, "Wow, how did they end up together?"

As someone who genuinely strives to be pro-heathy body image and  socially conscious, I realize that I'm contributing to a huge problem in a way that I never realized. I am equating myself and others to a subjective sense of beauty and worth that can't be standardized or wholly assessed by anybody. No one can determine who is in a certain league, because leagues don't exist.
29/01/2019, 06:50 - Dikshita Kothari: When someone says that you can say this
29/01/2019, 06:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Simply harassing my boy

30/01/2019, 13:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Pretty sick
30/01/2019, 14:20 - Jenit Jain: Like the informal logic is that guy family has to provide for you for life so something like that
30/01/2019, 14:20 - Jenit Jain: Kinda makes sense no offense
30/01/2019, 14:21 - Jenit Jain: But in today's zamana the relationship between in laws and bahu is informal so eh
30/01/2019, 14:21 - Jenit Jain: Pehle it was just for the sake of it

10/02/2019, 12:14 - Jenit Jain: Oksyyy
10/02/2019, 20:45 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
10/02/2019, 21:36 - Jenit Jain: You not even understanding your mistake shows how much you learned from our previous fights about the same reason. So next time you don't ask me why I keep fighting for the same reason.
10/02/2019, 21:36 - Jenit Jain: It's your fault only. No one elses
10/02/2019, 21:36 - Jenit Jain: Thanks for embarrassing and not even owning upto it
10/02/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Stop saying the same thing 5000 times
10/02/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I was drunk
10/02/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't know
10/02/2019, 21:41 - Jenit Jain: Stop doing the same thing 5000 times
10/02/2019, 21:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Bas you just need an excuse to fight
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Stop trying to dominate me
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like it
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Jenit Jain: I'm not gonna fight anyway. It just wastes my time. You're not going to do your end so fuck it
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Jenit Jain: Cool
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Dikshita Kothari: I am listening to you and you know it
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Change doesn't happen overnight
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Jenit Jain: cool
10/02/2019, 21:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Simply scolding me for the same thing isn't going to help
10/02/2019, 21:46 - Dikshita Kothari: What's more I gave you legit 0 shit for the somiya thing. Because I knew it would've been hard for you. That wasn't insulating for me or what. I got over it. I gave you time to get over it too. Instead of helping me and instead of asking me how I feel about it all you're doing it adding to the pressure and acting like a fucking dominating asshole. I told you you didn't consider my feelings last time. Did you improve on that ? No
10/02/2019, 21:47 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not the only one making the same mistake again and again Jen. You can't even see what mistake you made. What are you trying to do ? Make me scared of you ? Cause it's working. I now think I have to run everything past you cause you never know what will piss you off. So annoying. Let me be.
10/02/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: I didn't think of it this way but dikshita they were fucking assholes to you. You shouldn't be talking to them and I shouldn't be reminding you that you need not talk to them. You should be big enough to understand such a thing. Minor fuck ups are fine. What they did was major. You should be mature enough to know that
10/02/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: But you don't do anything about it
10/02/2019, 21:52 - Jenit Jain: Which hurts me more
10/02/2019, 21:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I WAS DRUNK
10/02/2019, 21:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I spoke to a stranger
10/02/2019, 21:53 - Jenit Jain: I'm not trying to make you scared of me. I'm just trying to make you listen.
10/02/2019, 21:53 - Dikshita Kothari: No Jen you are making me scared of you
10/02/2019, 21:54 - Jenit Jain: You need not be
10/02/2019, 21:58 - Dikshita Kothari: If you control me so much I'll stop telling you alltogether.  Please stop it. Don't try to dictate your terms on me. I don't think like you do and I never can. I don't want any trouble. Least of all from you. I tell you everything Jen just thoda let me be relaxed. Everytime I do something I don't want to think about oh god jenit kya bolega oh shit I can't fight over this again. Leave it I'll not tell him. The day this happens it'll be very bad baby please try to understand. The tighter you try to hold a lump of sand in your hand the faster it'll fall through. Don't try to assert yourself. What you say is important and I'll listen to you. But you have to give me some time. It's not easy for me.
10/02/2019, 21:58 - Dikshita Kothari: What do I do man I'll throw a bomb in their house kya.
10/02/2019, 21:59 - Dikshita Kothari: Jen I can't go around telling people they fucked up that's not my job
10/02/2019, 22:00 - Dikshita Kothari: And honestly I don't care. You don't want to talk to them, don't talk. I also won't but I don't want to feel uncomfortable everytime they're around. I've been through it with Nethraa. I hate that situation. You saw na what the girls said. It's not worth it.
10/02/2019, 22:00 - Dikshita Kothari: What's more they're complex components and they will always be so I won't really care about it.
10/02/2019, 22:01 - Dikshita Kothari: IN CAPITAL I WILL WRITE AGAIN- I WAS VERY DRUNK I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
10/02/2019, 22:01 - Dikshita Kothari: IF I WAS SOBER I WOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO THEM AS I DID NOT WHEN I MET THEM IN MCDONALD'S THE OTHER DAY
10/02/2019, 22:02 - Jenit Jain: Fine
10/02/2019, 22:02 - Jenit Jain: Okay I'll listen to you
10/02/2019, 22:02 - Dikshita Kothari: WHAT YOU SAY IS NOT LOST ON ME BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR ME TO GET ACCUSTOMED TO IT CAUSE I HAVE NEVER BEEN LIKE THIS AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE THIS. SO JUST AND ONLY FOR YOU I AM CHANGING THIS 'RULE' THAT I HAVE.
10/02/2019, 22:03 - Dikshita Kothari: It's already very difficult
10/02/2019, 22:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't give more BT about this please
10/02/2019, 22:04 - Jenit Jain: Okay

10/02/2019, 22:05 - Dikshita Kothari: It's difficult
10/02/2019, 22:05 - Jenit Jain: this thing mai i dont feel guilty about changing someone so okay thank you
10/02/2019, 22:05 - Jenit Jain: but im not going to apologise for it
10/02/2019, 22:05 - Dikshita Kothari: And because of this my mind is always in split
10/02/2019, 22:05 - Dikshita Kothari: What to do

10/02/2019, 22:06 - Dikshita Kothari: When I'm conscious

10/02/2019, 22:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I have no interest in being a grown up
10/02/2019, 22:08 - Dikshita Kothari: All I want to do is stay in Disney everyday
10/02/2019, 22:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I will not change this
10/02/2019, 22:08 - Dikshita Kothari: You get used to it

10/02/2019, 22:10 - Dikshita Kothari: Singlehandedly

15/02/2019, 07:36 - Jenit Jain: Accha got it
15/02/2019, 07:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Are you sure ?
15/02/2019, 07:38 - Jenit Jain: Yes
15/02/2019, 07:53 - Jenit Jain: In nominal m and n are always same right
15/02/2019, 07:53 - Dikshita Kothari: No
15/02/2019, 07:54 - Dikshita Kothari: In nominal n is always 1
15/02/2019, 07:54 - Dikshita Kothari: Compounding period and payment period is same
15/02/2019, 07:55 - Jenit Jain: If question is compounded binannually at 8%
15/02/2019, 07:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
15/02/2019, 07:55 - Jenit Jain: And if they are asking effective interest
15/02/2019, 07:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Nominal is 4%
15/02/2019, 07:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Effective is m= 2 n= 2
15/02/2019, 07:56 - Dikshita Kothari: If they said 18% compounded monthly 
Nominal is 1.5 % cause 18/12
15/02/2019, 07:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Over here 4% cause 8/2
15/02/2019, 07:57 - Jenit Jain: Understood
15/02/2019, 07:57 - Jenit Jain: Explain
15/02/2019, 07:57 - Dikshita Kothari: For effective interest its annual effective interest rate
15/02/2019, 07:57 - Dikshita Kothari: So pp= 1 year
15/02/2019, 07:58 - Dikshita Kothari: So in your question m = 2 n=2
15/02/2019, 07:58 - Jenit Jain: Ohh

03/03/2019, 18:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Pranjal EEE A.vcf (file attached)
03/03/2019, 18:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Go talk
03/03/2019, 18:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Alone
03/03/2019, 18:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Not with group
03/03/2019, 18:59 - Dikshita Kothari: Hello Pranjal 
This is about the message you sent me last night and everything before that. 
Thank you for being such a great friend and for always being so helpful. 
However, I feel that this is going too far and I should stop it before it gets worse. Please try and understand that I have a boyfriend who I love very much and I do not see you as more than a friend. Don't take this in a wrong way but I think you need to take a step back. This is for the better of both of us and ultimately even you will be less hurt in the future. I am sorry but nothing is going to happen between us ever. The faster you make peace with that the better it will be for you and me. I would still like to be your friend but I cannot be anything more.
03/03/2019, 20:10 - Jenit Jain: Are you sure you didn't text partg
03/03/2019, 20:12 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
03/03/2019, 20:16 - Jenit Jain: What did pranjal say
03/03/2019, 21:15 - Jenit Jain: Kaustubh and I met him. He came with his class people. I told him to come aside and he wasn't. So I started talking and then he obviously couldn't say. Then I got too violent so kaustubh took over. He couldn't say anything he was too shut. So we told his classmates to handle him. They said yeah bro. And his friends judged him when I showed them the 21list
03/03/2019, 21:16 - Jenit Jain: You will never acknowledge his existence.
03/03/2019, 21:16 - Jenit Jain: Jayant and rishab were on our side
03/03/2019, 21:16 - Jenit Jain: They judged him
03/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: No physical
03/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: And. Not apologising for my behavior today
03/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: Goodnight.
03/03/2019, 21:24 - Jenit Jain: PS you won't be losing any friends.
03/03/2019, 21:30 - Jenit Jain: PS I was VERY cordial with rishab and jayant. They are very nice and they were very understanding
03/03/2019, 21:33 - Jenit Jain: And we gave pranjal a very fair chance to explain his side so that we are not in the wrong. We said you explain your side and kaustubh said that if we are wrong we'll get you beer
03/03/2019, 21:33 - Jenit Jain: And also, he confessed he likes you.
03/03/2019, 21:41 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
03/03/2019, 21:57 - Dikshita Kothari: Thank you
03/03/2019, 22:00 - Jenit Jain: That's all you want to say?
03/03/2019, 22:03 - Dikshita Kothari: It's good
03/03/2019, 22:03 - Dikshita Kothari: It's fine
03/03/2019, 22:06 - Jenit Jain: Okay
03/03/2019, 22:13 - Dikshita Kothari: Love you Jen don't not talk to me next time I feel damn sad
03/03/2019, 22:16 - Jenit Jain: Let's see
03/03/2019, 22:16 - Jenit Jain: Sorry not sorry for scratching your hand
03/03/2019, 22:17 - Jenit Jain: Also did your mom pay 500 less to him
03/03/2019, 22:17 - Jenit Jain: Because I have him 500
03/03/2019, 22:17 - Jenit Jain: Please confirm with her
03/03/2019, 22:18 - Jenit Jain: So that she can pay less tomorrow
03/03/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Hi Jen
03/03/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Sorry baby mom just slept
03/03/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: We were talking actually
03/03/2019, 23:23 - Jenit Jain: It's fine
03/03/2019, 23:23 - Jenit Jain: About what
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: So she's damn smart as I had told you
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't worry she still likes you a lot
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: The thing is that she was awake
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Jenit Jain: ButM
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Jenit Jain: I knew it
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: While going and coming back
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Jenit Jain: Fair enough
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: And she's taken your side through and through
03/03/2019, 23:24 - Jenit Jain: Oh well
03/03/2019, 23:25 - Jenit Jain: But she didn't like the way I talk!
03/03/2019, 23:25 - Jenit Jain: ?*
03/03/2019, 23:25 - Dikshita Kothari: And she said that I was wrong in not making it absolutely clear and she understands why I didn't do it cause I'm from a girls school and I feel shy to talk about all these things and don't like confrontation and all
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Dikshita Kothari: No no
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Dikshita Kothari: She loved you
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: I also know this
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Dikshita Kothari: She's given dry fruits to give to you
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: I shall flady accept
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: Tell her that js
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: And sorry that she had to hear it
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Dikshita Kothari: But she was sad that you were sullen on the trip
03/03/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: I you had fun tell her
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Dikshita Kothari: Haan ok
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Jenit Jain: I love you.
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Dikshita Kothari: I shall
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Dikshita Kothari: I love you too sweetie
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Dikshita Kothari: What's the scene with Pranjal
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Jenit Jain: How are the scratches
03/03/2019, 23:27 - Dikshita Kothari: Did you insult him ?
03/03/2019, 23:28 - Jenit Jain: No talking no communication no existence. Everyone else is fine
03/03/2019, 23:28 - Jenit Jain: Duh
03/03/2019, 23:28 - Dikshita Kothari: Or hit him or something
03/03/2019, 23:28 - Jenit Jain: I nudged him
03/03/2019, 23:28 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
03/03/2019, 23:28 - Jenit Jain: I then concentrated on jayant and rishab
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Dikshita Kothari: Got it
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Jenit Jain: Cool
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Dikshita Kothari: I apologise for not making it clear to them
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Jenit Jain: Good
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Dikshita Kothari: But you should know that I tried
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Jenit Jain: Not hard enough clearly
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Jenit Jain: But okau
03/03/2019, 23:29 - Jenit Jain: At least you accept
03/03/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: And mom has asked me to tell you to stop being insecure and also to tell you that I am not untrustworthy
03/03/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: Aiyo
03/03/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Because I spoke to her and she's like wah you tell him everything
03/03/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: Tell her that I implied to one incident
03/03/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: I was like ya
03/03/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: Because you couldn't complete your part
03/03/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause I feel guilty to not tell
03/03/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: Why would she be surprised that you do. She's also like vidushi Kya 😂
03/03/2019, 23:31 - Dikshita Kothari: She's like then good it is that you keep him in confidence but then why is he calling you untrustworthy
03/03/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: Did you explain only because you couldn't keep your part?
03/03/2019, 23:32 - Dikshita Kothari: That does not make me untrustworthy
03/03/2019, 23:32 - Dikshita Kothari: That makes me not open to confrontation
03/03/2019, 23:32 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't confuse terms
03/03/2019, 23:32 - Dikshita Kothari: Untrustworthy hurts because I have never ever lied to you ever
03/03/2019, 23:33 - Jenit Jain: Because it feels like you don't even try. Because of the number of times it has happened
03/03/2019, 23:33 - Dikshita Kothari: And this I will never be open to confrontation in the future either
03/03/2019, 23:33 - Jenit Jain: Just delayed info
03/03/2019, 23:33 - Jenit Jain: Learn. I'm getting hurt because of you because of this more than enough
03/03/2019, 23:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay got it 
I agree it's happened a number of times 
But each time you should understand that I don't think that it's such a big deal cause I don't give a shit and you do 
Mom also said ki tu usko batayi nahi ki terko farak nahi padta 
I said bataya but he's too easily affected so she's like oh 
She said just do it for his sake sometimes it's easier that way than actually changing your thought process
03/03/2019, 23:36 - Jenit Jain: I didn't want your mom to know this side so early in relationship according to her
03/03/2019, 23:37 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not going to learn this 
You accept it 
I don't like making people feel bad about anything it sucks the enthusiasm from myself and I can't deal with the negative energy 
So no I will not 'learn' how to confront people 
I am not comfortable with it
03/03/2019, 23:37 - Dikshita Kothari: What ?
03/03/2019, 23:37 - Dikshita Kothari: It's fine she likes you
03/03/2019, 23:37 - Dikshita Kothari: She understands
03/03/2019, 23:37 - Jenit Jain: Early relationship (according to her)
03/03/2019, 23:37 - Dikshita Kothari: But she understands me as well
03/03/2019, 23:37 - Jenit Jain: Per chue isliye
03/03/2019, 23:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Haha maybe
03/03/2019, 23:38 - Jenit Jain: Fine I'll confront peacefully for you
03/03/2019, 23:38 - Dikshita Kothari: .
03/03/2019, 23:38 - Dikshita Kothari: You wanna confront people okay do it 
But you should do it without insulating them cause then you're just removing anger and not making valid points
03/03/2019, 23:39 - Dikshita Kothari: This is an observation and not an assumption
03/03/2019, 23:39 - Dikshita Kothari: I have seen it
03/03/2019, 23:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
03/03/2019, 23:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Last thing I have to say
03/03/2019, 23:40 - Dikshita Kothari: About what happened today
03/03/2019, 23:41 - Jenit Jain: Exactly I know, but today I made sense because I was right. I said everything correctly because it is borderline harassment. No girl of mine is going to go through that under my watch.
03/03/2019, 23:41 - Jenit Jain: Say
03/03/2019, 23:44 - Jenit Jain: !!!!
03/03/2019, 23:44 - Jenit Jain: Don't cry
03/03/2019, 23:45 - Jenit Jain: And say
03/03/2019, 23:45 - Dikshita Kothari: I want three apologies from you 
1. I don't know why the fuck you think it's okay to hit me when you're angry. I don't know when I made it okay to do it in your head. Okay when you're doing it playfully I understand. But today it was in anger and I would've cried almost if mom wasn't sitting there and I didn't have to make you look good. Moreover I can't believe you said that you're not going to apologise for scratching me. And pushing my hand away and whatnot. Even if you were irritated you can't do that. This was not okay Jen. I'm really hurt. 
2. Please apologise for calling me untrustworthy you know I'm not. 
3. Apologise for your behaviour today. You knew it was my last day with mom. You knew I'm going to be sad tomorrow. You made me feel as if it would've been better to not invite both of you.
03/03/2019, 23:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Not done
03/03/2019, 23:46 - Dikshita Kothari: At all
03/03/2019, 23:46 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm going for a shower
03/03/2019, 23:47 - Dikshita Kothari: I want my apologies once I'm done
03/03/2019, 23:47 - Dikshita Kothari: That's it
03/03/2019, 23:48 - Jenit Jain: Okay I'm sorry for all three.
Yes it's not okay t hit you ever. No exceptions.
You know I meant untrustworthy for not keeping your end. Not in any other way. I know never cheating wise. I know.
I know you will be sad. But you ruined my entire day in the morning
03/03/2019, 23:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Thank you
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: You didn't even tell me you felt awkward or about the message itself
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't tell me I had any end to keep
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: Make sure he stays as a friend
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: Was your end
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I did that
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: You didn't keep it
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I never felt anything
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Dikshita Kothari: For him
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: He did na
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Dikshita Kothari: How can I control his feelings
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: Ik
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Dikshita Kothari: You think I led him on ?
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Do you Jen
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: Aukad mai rak kar
03/03/2019, 23:49 - Jenit Jain: No
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Jenit Jain: Not at all
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Did you ever see me showing off cleavage
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Or sleeveless
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Or shorts
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Jenit Jain: No da wth
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Or something
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Jenit Jain: I don't want such allegations
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't understand what you mean then ?
03/03/2019, 23:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Explain your end
03/03/2019, 23:51 - Jenit Jain: Fucl it
 It's over and decided. Fighting over it doesn't make sense
03/03/2019, 23:51 - Jenit Jain: It done and dusted
03/03/2019, 23:51 - Dikshita Kothari: No it's not
03/03/2019, 23:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Answer me
03/03/2019, 23:51 - Dikshita Kothari: What did I do
03/03/2019, 23:51 - Dikshita Kothari: That you called me untrustworthy
03/03/2019, 23:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Oh wait I'm not done
03/03/2019, 23:52 - Jenit Jain: He kept liking you and you didn't make sure by any means necessary that he stops. So I had to intervene because it's just a negative situation to be in for both of us
03/03/2019, 23:53 - Dikshita Kothari: For the third one Jen thank you for being so fucking selfish 
I tried to do what was right by me 
To tell you what happened as soon as it was possible 
I'm sorry I was tired and wanted to sleep the previous night ? 
Should I have told you in the return journey ? You would've said then why you didn't tell me while coming.
03/03/2019, 23:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't think it was negative for me and I don't know how it affected you so much
03/03/2019, 23:54 - Dikshita Kothari: 'any means necessary' is not my style as I have justified already in my non confrontation idea
03/03/2019, 23:55 - Jenit Jain: I told you about sannidhi being weird once as soon as class got over and I met you
03/03/2019, 23:55 - Jenit Jain: So I FUCKING HANDLED IT
03/03/2019, 23:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't you dare call me dishonest / untrustworthy / disloyal ever again 
God knows I share what and how I share things with you like I would with my mother when the time is right and we have free time to talk about it
03/03/2019, 23:56 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have a problem with that 
Pranjal crossed a line

04/03/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: Also
04/03/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: This
04/03/2019, 22:41 - Jenit Jain: And this
04/03/2019, 22:42 - Jenit Jain: Are the same expenses
04/03/2019, 22:42 - Jenit Jain: So twice it got deducted or what
04/03/2019, 22:42 - Jenit Jain: From the 2 cards?
04/03/2019, 22:44 - Jenit Jain: Plus the reason we always fight is pretty much uprooted. Thanks for showing the support for it
04/03/2019, 22:44 - Dikshita Kothari: What ?
04/03/2019, 22:45 - Jenit Jain: Nothing gn
04/03/2019, 22:50 - Jenit Jain: I'm sorry but my patience has run out
04/03/2019, 23:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
04/03/2019, 23:02 - Jenit Jain: .
04/03/2019, 23:03 - Dikshita Kothari: You feel wrong
04/03/2019, 23:03 - Dikshita Kothari: I think you should try to understand my point of view
04/03/2019, 23:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Pranjal I will definitely not talk cause you're not comfortable clearly
04/03/2019, 23:03 - Jenit Jain: I understood. I saw how it works. I didn't like it and you didn't change it.
04/03/2019, 23:03 - Dikshita Kothari: But then again and again same thing is happening
04/03/2019, 23:04 - Jenit Jain: What
04/03/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: Why should I even bother making friends if you're going to tell me to not talk to them or something like that 
Shouldn't you leave those decisions to me
04/03/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like being a puppet jen
04/03/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: You're my favourite
04/03/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: And I love you so much
04/03/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: But you're not there with me all the time na
04/03/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: I also need people around me
04/03/2019, 23:05 - Dikshita Kothari: To talk to or chill with or whatever
04/03/2019, 23:07 - Jenit Jain: I never stop you from making friends. Yes I do speak very negative all the time but then I learned to stop. I can't help it if some of your friends are shits. You do realize that pranjal basically indirectly agreed that he took advantage of your naïve nature and kept on Pursuing. No one said a word but everyone there agreed
04/03/2019, 23:08 - Jenit Jain: Other people also take advantage of that thing only
04/03/2019, 23:08 - Jenit Jain: Kshitij I don't like. But he still hasn't fucked up in anyway so I don't even say about him
04/03/2019, 23:09 - Jenit Jain: Don't think this way. I'm just guarding you. If you think this way then I can't help it
04/03/2019, 23:13 - Dikshita Kothari: Tomorrow if I say that vidit is a  bad influence on you 
All he's putting into your head all bullshit in your head 
You're around too much negativity 
Stop talking to him immediately 
I'm not comfortable with it 
Then what would you do ?
04/03/2019, 23:13 - Jenit Jain: You're talking bs. What I made him do is confess in front of everyone.
04/03/2019, 23:13 - Jenit Jain: He even got a turn to speak he just couldn't.
04/03/2019, 23:14 - Jenit Jain: You take it as a compromise or whatever. It's done. No one is going to change it. All you can do is accept it.
04/03/2019, 23:14 - Jenit Jain: I'll do the same thing if I have to if it's necessary.
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Jenit Jain: But rn it's clearly not
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Everyone already knew Jen
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: You leave Pranjal for a moment
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Generally think for anyone
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: For example if Kshitij makes a mistake 
I will come and tell you first 
Your solution will be - stop talking to him he's a little shit
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: And then you'll go and scare him so he's going to stop talking to me also
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Now Kshitij will stop means Shashank will also stop
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Jenit Jain: So move past it and text me.
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Jenit Jain: I can't help it if all your bonds are through people
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Jenit Jain: Stop blaming me
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: It's just one more semester
04/03/2019, 23:15 - Jenit Jain: I'm not taking any of it
04/03/2019, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: Tell yourself thay
04/03/2019, 23:16 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not blaming you baba
04/03/2019, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: Then they were complex anyway
04/03/2019, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: Great

04/03/2019, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: TRULY.

04/03/2019, 23:17 - Dikshita Kothari: And your solution isn't even a solution it's an ultimatum
04/03/2019, 23:19 - Jenit Jain: I will give you the same explanation because it's true.
04/03/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't mind being called naive. It's okay if people think I am. I will help them in whatever way I can. You are not letting me be a happy go lucky person. I am feeling pretty suffocated. 
Why won't you let me have a little control over my life and my friends.
04/03/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: Your problem is not worth listening too because nothing in your class will change
04/03/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I listened with saurak and Parth and I left them
04/03/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I can count my friends in one hand Jen
04/03/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: Well if you're feeling suffocated you shouldn't
04/03/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: Go out and do whatever you want

04/03/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Why don't you understand my nature ?
04/03/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I just want everyone around me to get along
04/03/2019, 23:21 - Jenit Jain: Call me
04/03/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
04/03/2019, 23:21 - Jenit Jain: I don't wanna text

04/03/2019, 23:23 - Jenit Jain: Okay
04/03/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: My side is not even worthy enough for you to pay attention for five minutes

04/03/2019, 23:40 - Jenit Jain: So was somiya.
04/03/2019, 23:40 - Jenit Jain: You don't see me crying about it.

04/03/2019, 23:42 - Jenit Jain: Honestly I have heard his name enough time after I told you it's done. You must really cherish him. Thanks for lying about the complex part. I'm done. You text me now, I'll block you. Instead, just wish me goodnight. Think everything through and when you've made your peace with it, text me
04/03/2019, 23:42 - Jenit Jain: And you're being petty now.

Pranjal didn't do anything. I may be naive but I'm not going to allow you to break a good friendship for a stupid ego issue that will not affect anyone in the long run.
06/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: It's becoming pretty difficult
06/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Love you too sweetie
06/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: But when you're wrong you're wrong
06/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: You can speak to Anjali about it

06/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Divya even
06/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: From any girls point of view
06/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: You're wrong
06/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: All your friends have to support you cause well they're all men
06/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: And your male ego and possessiveness is justified among them
06/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: I will not take this bs anymore Jen
06/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm pretty tired of trying to convince you
06/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: You know I love you
06/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: And I'll never love anyone else

06/03/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need protection from pranjall
06/03/2019, 11:13 - Jenit Jain: Doesn't matters
06/03/2019, 11:13 - Jenit Jain: It's done now
06/03/2019, 11:13 - Jenit Jain: You accept it
06/03/2019, 11:14 - Jenit Jain: Next time such a thing happens and when you get the chance, you handle it properly
06/03/2019, 11:14 - Jenit Jain: This is done
06/03/2019, 11:14 - Jenit Jain: Move on
06/03/2019, 11:14 - Jenit Jain: You weren't going to talk to him 6months later anyway like you said
06/03/2019, 11:14 - Jenit Jain: So why waste any more timr
06/03/2019, 11:14 - Jenit Jain: It's done and finalized
06/03/2019, 11:27 - Dikshita Kothari: No

06/03/2019, 11:28 - Dikshita Kothari: Before it wasn't

06/03/2019, 11:31 - Dikshita Kothari: There are people  who will always spread rumours about you. There are people  who will always cause drama involving you, but the only thing you can do is RISE ABOVE THEM AND SMILE.  Tell yourself , that despite all you stand strong.  I have heard the lies, though I speak only truth.  I was thrown to hell  but I built my own heaven.  I have restored my strength so none can shake my grounds. At the end of the day stand up for what you believe in even if it means standing alone.  Good morning.

07/03/2019, 09:11 - Dikshita Kothari: <Media omitted>
07/03/2019, 09:12 - Jenit Jain: Green cos I'm sad that my gf fights with me
07/03/2019, 09:14 - Dikshita Kothari: Red and Blue cause I'm angry and sad that I have no control
07/03/2019, 09:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Green is for guilty
07/03/2019, 09:15 - Dikshita Kothari: So I'm going to go with you're finally feeling guilty
07/03/2019, 09:16 - Jenit Jain: I'm wearing blue also
07/03/2019, 09:16 - Jenit Jain: Green not counted
07/03/2019, 09:17 - Jenit Jain: I read wrong
07/03/2019, 09:17 - Jenit Jain: You realise how embarrassed I'll be if I tell hasn't pranjal baat karle. My image is gonna go in the dirt
07/03/2019, 09:17 - Jenit Jain: Do you want that
07/03/2019, 09:31 - Dikshita Kothari: Image in front of whom , my class people?? 
Also why do you want your image to be of someone who doesn't allow their girlfriend to talk to people 
Image means ego 
You're breaking my friendship cause you have too much ego 
What about my image 
According to my image now I'm a stupid girl whose life is controlled by her boyfriend. Who can't stand up for herself. And whose chosen a boyfriend to fight her battles for her. I want my image to be of someone who is chill and sweet. Didn't you like me cause I was sweet. That was the only thing in my personality. Dikshita is very sweet. And now dikshita is not even sweet anymore. Dikshita is a puppet and everyone hates her cause she doesn't stand up for what she feels is right. She just listens to someone else. Cause she doesn't have a choice. 
The most important thing in her life is jenit. She does whatever jenit wants and however he wants her to do it. If jenit told her to drop ice cream on her shirt otherwise he will break up with her she will drop that ice cream cause she is too scared to lose him. She knows jenit is insecure but she doesn't know why and she is frankly tired of massaging his ego and letting hers just become non existent. 
But after all this also jenit will be too "embarrassed" of his girlfriend. Cause his girlfriend is a dumb fool who wants to do right by everyone and not make anyone sad. She tries her best but ultimately has to do what jenit says cause otherwise jenit will be too "embarrassed". Dikshita is not only embarrassed of what has happened she's also sad, guilty, angry, confused, empty, unenthusiastic. But jenit is embarrassed. So dikshita must listen to what he has to say otherwise jenit will leave her. 
Can I talk to my friend? Why can't I talk? Mom brought a pen for Pranjal can I give it to him? Can I say what I want or will jenit feel bad if I talk? 
These are the questions I have to ask you in the future? Then the future is seeming very difficult for me jenit. And to me it's now looking like an old Marwari family where the wife has to cover her head and sit while the man does all the work cause he is trying to "protect" her.
07/03/2019, 09:31 - Dikshita Kothari: I probably won't make it to 10:30 class
07/03/2019, 09:34 - Jenit Jain: Wow you just took it way far ahead
07/03/2019, 09:34 - Jenit Jain: And yes, Jenit will feel very bad if you talk
07/03/2019, 09:35 - Jenit Jain: You're just exaggerating everything now
07/03/2019, 09:35 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not exaggerating anything
07/03/2019, 09:35 - Dikshita Kothari: This is how I feel
07/03/2019, 09:35 - Dikshita Kothari: And this is what is going to happen in the future
07/03/2019, 09:35 - Jenit Jain: You presume to know everything.

07/03/2019, 09:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Jenit will say no that place is too far don't go there to work I can't protect you there

07/03/2019, 09:36 - Jenit Jain: And just making bad allegations
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Dikshita Kothari: Then you will say go for work but don't talk to anyone cause they're weird people chi
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Dikshita Kothari: This is how I feel
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Jenit Jain: One time I'm asking you to do something severe
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Dikshita Kothari: And how I will feel for a very long time
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Jenit Jain: Great
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Dikshita Kothari: I have never asked you to do anything
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Dikshita Kothari: And you shouldn't be asking me either
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Jenit Jain: Sure.
07/03/2019, 09:37 - Dikshita Kothari: What have I asked you tell any one thing
07/03/2019, 09:38 - Jenit Jain: I'm asking you as a bf. You decide what you want to do
07/03/2019, 09:38 - Jenit Jain: I can't remember now
07/03/2019, 09:38 - Jenit Jain: But I'm sure 3 years Mai I have done enough
07/03/2019, 09:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause there was nothing that you would remember forever
07/03/2019, 09:38 - Dikshita Kothari: No decision that I forced on you
07/03/2019, 09:39 - Dikshita Kothari: You've done a lot for me Jen
07/03/2019, 09:39 - Dikshita Kothari: But I didn't ask for anything
07/03/2019, 09:39 - Jenit Jain: I just accepted anything you say because you're smart most of the time
07/03/2019, 09:39 - Dikshita Kothari: Except weed and that is just shitty
07/03/2019, 09:39 - Jenit Jain: Cool. I get hownit works. Next time you need me to do something make sure you ask for it. You don't want good gestures so be it
07/03/2019, 09:39 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't do anything cause otherwise you will leave me isn't it
07/03/2019, 09:40 - Jenit Jain: That's why I didn't bring it up
07/03/2019, 09:40 - Jenit Jain: Idk
07/03/2019, 09:40 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't want to leave weed?
07/03/2019, 09:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Go go
07/03/2019, 09:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Smoke as much as you want
07/03/2019, 09:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't blame it on me
07/03/2019, 09:41 - Jenit Jain: I left that's why you I didn't say anything and I don't think it was a bad decision on your part either so why critisize
07/03/2019, 09:41 - Dikshita Kothari: You've done a lot for me Jen I know it.
07/03/2019, 09:41 - Jenit Jain: No more
07/03/2019, 09:42 - Dikshita Kothari: No no if you want to do you please continue
07/03/2019, 09:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Is that so
07/03/2019, 09:42 - Jenit Jain: Yes
07/03/2019, 09:42 - Jenit Jain: It clearly does me no good and you will still continue to make shit allegations and presume the future so no thanks
07/03/2019, 09:43 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't even say anything anymore without you becoming angry with me or threatening to break up or anything
07/03/2019, 09:43 - Jenit Jain: I didn't even threaten
07/03/2019, 09:43 - Jenit Jain: Becoming angry is plausible
07/03/2019, 09:43 - Dikshita Kothari: You said you won't do anything for me anymore
07/03/2019, 09:44 - Jenit Jain: That is an update
07/03/2019, 09:44 - Jenit Jain: Not a threat
07/03/2019, 09:44 - Dikshita Kothari: You hate me

07/03/2019, 09:45 - Jenit Jain: I'm on your side

07/03/2019, 09:45 - Dikshita Kothari: You should've seen
07/03/2019, 09:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Yesterday when I went for the match
07/03/2019, 09:45 - Dikshita Kothari: You should've seen the way everyone looked at me
07/03/2019, 09:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause they didn't
07/03/2019, 09:45 - Dikshita Kothari: No one said hi
07/03/2019, 09:46 - Dikshita Kothari: No one cares
07/03/2019, 09:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Everyone said hi to Divya
07/03/2019, 09:46 - Dikshita Kothari: I was standing right there
07/03/2019, 09:46 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't care for a hi right

07/03/2019, 09:47 - Jenit Jain: Eventually
07/03/2019, 09:47 - Jenit Jain: Whenever you're ready
07/03/2019, 09:47 - Dikshita Kothari: I have no option
07/03/2019, 09:47 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have any options
07/03/2019, 09:47 - Jenit Jain: Cool
07/03/2019, 09:47 - Dikshita Kothari: I just do as jenit says

07/03/2019, 09:49 - Jenit Jain: Okay
07/03/2019, 09:49 - Dikshita Kothari: That's damn rude
07/03/2019, 09:49 - Jenit Jain: So are you
07/03/2019, 09:50 - Dikshita Kothari: So were you
07/03/2019, 09:50 - Jenit Jain: But I want robot dikshita only
07/03/2019, 09:51 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't like me?
07/03/2019, 09:51 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm a person not a machine
07/03/2019, 09:51 - Jenit Jain: I love you
07/03/2019, 09:51 - Dikshita Kothari: And I can't be what you want me to be
07/03/2019, 09:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Ever
07/03/2019, 09:51 - Jenit Jain: Sucks to be I guess
07/03/2019, 09:52 - Jenit Jain: Me*
07/03/2019, 09:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I love you too
07/03/2019, 09:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Now I'm not even enough for you
07/03/2019, 09:53 - Jenit Jain: You are. It's just youre being adamant about a wasteful thing So I will have to teach you what's what
07/03/2019, 09:53 - Dikshita Kothari: No you don't have to teach me anything
07/03/2019, 09:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I know right from wrong
07/03/2019, 09:53 - Jenit Jain: Can't I teach my gf a small thing also?
07/03/2019, 09:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I know you're wrong
07/03/2019, 09:54 - Dikshita Kothari: No you can't I already know all these things
07/03/2019, 09:54 - Jenit Jain: Then just accept your bf for the fuckednup person he is
07/03/2019, 09:54 - Dikshita Kothari: You were never like this before
07/03/2019, 09:54 - Dikshita Kothari: This semester suddenly something you're doing
07/03/2019, 09:55 - Dikshita Kothari: You made me lose a friend
07/03/2019, 09:55 - Dikshita Kothari: A nahi
07/03/2019, 09:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Many friends
07/03/2019, 09:59 - Jenit Jain: You see the reason for each and everyone and tell me if there's a friend without reason you tell me
07/03/2019, 10:01 - Jenit Jain: It was always there. It's just that I waited patiently for you to handle it
07/03/2019, 10:02 - Jenit Jain: And you couldn't
07/03/2019, 10:02 - Jenit Jain: Don't irritate me now
07/03/2019, 10:09 - Jenit Jain: Have fun at revels
07/03/2019, 10:35 - Jenit Jain: !!
07/03/2019, 10:43 - Dikshita Kothari: You only said don't irritate
07/03/2019, 10:43 - Jenit Jain: Okay great
07/03/2019, 10:44 - Jenit Jain: Tell me if you want to have lunch. I'm not participating. I have errands
07/03/2019, 10:44 - Jenit Jain: You're treating
07/03/2019, 10:48 - Jenit Jain: Yes or no
07/03/2019, 10:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Okk
07/03/2019, 10:52 - Dikshita Kothari: What time
07/03/2019, 10:52 - Jenit Jain: 1230
07/03/2019, 10:53 - Jenit Jain: Acchese I was taking part
07/03/2019, 10:53 - Dikshita Kothari: What errands?
07/03/2019, 10:54 - Dikshita Kothari: You should take part now also
07/03/2019, 10:55 - Jenit Jain: Give a parcel to udupi but mostly not get annoyed by you agakn
07/03/2019, 10:55 - Jenit Jain: Morning morning Mai you ruin the mood
07/03/2019, 10:54 - Dikshita Kothari: For these fights you shouldn't give up a good experience
07/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: But I don't have a say in what you do anyway
07/03/2019, 10:55 - Dikshita Kothari: So do what you want
07/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Annoying irritating
07/03/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Anything else?
07/03/2019, 10:57 - Dikshita Kothari: Do what you want man
07/03/2019, 10:57 - Jenit Jain: Never said that. Again with these presumptions
07/03/2019, 10:57 - Dikshita Kothari: So then you should do events
07/03/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: How many times I've told you this
07/03/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Haan but I annoy you
07/03/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: I understand
07/03/2019, 10:58 - Jenit Jain: You stop with this fight then. It's annoying and I can't be productive because of it
07/03/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: You stop it
07/03/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Why should I stop it
07/03/2019, 11:00 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't even want to go to class anymore
07/03/2019, 11:00 - Dikshita Kothari: It's "annoying" to feel like this
07/03/2019, 11:00 - Dikshita Kothari: Fine I'll put a pause
07/03/2019, 11:00 - Dikshita Kothari: If you come for revels
07/03/2019, 11:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Otherwise I'll keep "annoying" you
07/03/2019, 11:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Pause
07/03/2019, 11:02 - Jenit Jain: I don't want it at all. Dikshita it's done. It ain't change now why don't you understand. You want me to go tell a guy to talk to my gf after threatening him?
07/03/2019, 11:05 - Jenit Jain: Yes it's true you didn't get it your way but it's not like I didn't give you chance. So stop being so aggressive with me. Your friend couldn't handle your friendship which affevtrd me. If that friendship meant so much for him he would have preserved it instead of being a lover boy for years. Dikshita it had to be done. Please stop fighting.
07/03/2019, 11:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to tell him anything
07/03/2019, 11:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I'll talk directly
07/03/2019, 11:26 - Jenit Jain: You had enough opportunities. So nothing will be done now. Moreover we didnt even hit him. It would have been only so much better if you did it yourself
07/03/2019, 11:26 - Jenit Jain: So dw about that
07/03/2019, 11:34 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't give me a chance 
If it was going to become so serious and you would've told me I would've fixed it a little more harsh manner mein not broken the friendship altogether that's a very wrong thing that happened. If it had to be done I would realise it. It didn't have to be done and it was unnecessary. We were so happy before this. Now it's like you've done something I'll never forget. Cause it's hurt me so much. You can't tell me when to stop fighting and when to not. 
Jenit I was so simple and easy. Doing all this you're making me a very complex person. I don't like myself right now how can I expect you to love me. Let me do things my way. I told you not to interfere and you didn't even do that. You are acting difficult. I let everything go that's why you think it's okay to do what you did but it's not. And I'm angry with you and sad for everything else. We were so happy Jen. Nothing was wrong. You didn't have to do this and ruin everything.
07/03/2019, 11:35 - Dikshita Kothari: I want to do it myself now
07/03/2019, 11:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Fix or unfix
07/03/2019, 11:35 - Dikshita Kothari: It's my choice
07/03/2019, 11:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Not yours
07/03/2019, 11:35 - Dikshita Kothari: I came for 11:30 class
07/03/2019, 11:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Lunch if you want
07/03/2019, 11:39 - Jenit Jain: So you do agree not doing anything. You didn't even consider my advice to tell me him keep his distance. Youndid everything for so long at your own accord which is practically nothing. Then you lie and say you tried to fix it and I believed you. So don't blame if your carelessness cost you a friendship. You basically confessed of it being your fault.
07/03/2019, 11:40 - Jenit Jain: So yes don't fight now
07/03/2019, 11:40 - Jenit Jain: Maybe we were way happier in the past because everything worked according to your needs only
07/03/2019, 11:41 - Jenit Jain: All this you won't see. Itna time I supported you because I thought you would support me by talking to him and telling him to calm the fuck down. You clearly didn't see my problem and certainly didn't act on it. So I'm doing the same now. I'm not going to change my decision.
07/03/2019, 11:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre if course I talked to him
07/03/2019, 11:42 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't lie
07/03/2019, 11:43 - Dikshita Kothari: But no situation needs such harsh handling
07/03/2019, 11:44 - Jenit Jain: It wasn't harsh man
07/03/2019, 11:45 - Jenit Jain: I didn't beat him up
07/03/2019, 11:45 - Jenit Jain: It was apt
07/03/2019, 11:44 - Dikshita Kothari: You supported me what do you want me to tell you
Thank you so much Jen I know you do a lot for me I know it really. But like if you didn't want to support me you tell me that
07/03/2019, 11:45 - Dikshita Kothari: And then I do something about it
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Dikshita Kothari: No no no
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Jenit Jain: I supported you. Now your turn to support me
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Dikshita Kothari: I could've done that
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Jenit Jain: I gave you many chances dik
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Jenit Jain: You didn't take any of them seriously
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Jenit Jain: How's that's my fault
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Dikshita Kothari: I always support you but not here when you're wrong
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Dikshita Kothari: You tell me one situation in which you told me to do anything like Sunday
07/03/2019, 11:48 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't think it would affect you so much
07/03/2019, 11:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't know you were so insecure
07/03/2019, 11:50 - Jenit Jain: You know how much it affects seeing that this is the main reason we fighting
07/03/2019, 11:50 - Jenit Jain: I'm not insecure
07/03/2019, 11:50 - Jenit Jain: You know that
07/03/2019, 11:50 - Jenit Jain: It's just that extra thing nudging our relationship
07/03/2019, 11:53 - Jenit Jain: Deep about this. I trust you enough. BUT YOU DIDNT TAKE ME SERIOUSLY AFTER EXPRESSINH MY CONCERNS MULTIPLE TIME HENCE YOU GAVE ME NO CHOICE. YOU CANT EVEN SAY THAT YOU THOUGHT IT DIDNT AFFRCT ME. WE FUCKING FIGHT FOR LEGIT USUALLY FOR THIS ONLY.  So I'm sorry you couldn't take my reaction for how serious they always were. Because clearly you don't think I can get pissed at you. It's literally your fault that you didn't handle it. How many times am I supposed to even say. You don't listen only. next time maybe I say something and you'll actually take it seriously, maybe.
07/03/2019, 12:08 - Jenit Jain: Reply
07/03/2019, 12:15 - Dikshita Kothari: We never used to fight about this
07/03/2019, 12:17 - Jenit Jain: We always fought about your annoying classmates and lover boys
07/03/2019, 12:50 - Jenit Jain: Since you are so adamant about your part and I'm more adamant about my part. And I made a decision for you, you go do anything you want. Even I'll see what you can do. And I also insist you talk to harshit and arav since they share a similar pov and you wanted to know who is on my side.
07/03/2019, 12:50 - Jenit Jain: Dekthe hai what you do.
07/03/2019, 12:50 - Jenit Jain: So go, do.
07/03/2019, 12:53 - Jenit Jain: Remember, it will be causing you to be my alibi when I try to destroy pranjals college life. And you will be on the spot then also, plus it will hurt our relationship even more. Plus he's gonna get his ass handed to him
07/03/2019, 12:59 - Jenit Jain: Also how about you tell your mom about the s and p thing
07/03/2019, 12:59 - Jenit Jain: And then the board game day
07/03/2019, 13:00 - Jenit Jain: Since you anyway include her so much in our relationship give her a full view na she can actually judge me with the whole picture
07/03/2019, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: Now only we're fighting about this
07/03/2019, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: Before we never fought about that
07/03/2019, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't handle it I did handle it I know I handled it 
He was not irritating me at all 
We were fine !
07/03/2019, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: He never used to push like that
07/03/2019, 12:24 - Dikshita Kothari: I never felt anything
07/03/2019, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: No I don't
07/03/2019, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: Nothing we ever fought about Pranjal
07/03/2019, 12:25 - Dikshita Kothari: We didn't fight even once about him
07/03/2019, 13:01 - Jenit Jain: Right
07/03/2019, 13:01 - Jenit Jain: Sure haan
07/03/2019, 13:02 - Jenit Jain: I wonder how I've kept my feeling of punching him in the face so many times. I'm sure I've shared them with you
07/03/2019, 13:02 - Jenit Jain: So I know it has come up
07/03/2019, 13:12 - Jenit Jain: Reply
07/03/2019, 13:13 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have a choice only
07/03/2019, 13:13 - Dikshita Kothari: I have the right to make my own decisions
07/03/2019, 13:13 - Jenit Jain: And you could have
07/03/2019, 13:13 - Jenit Jain: You failed
07/03/2019, 13:13 - Dikshita Kothari: You ruined everything and you're so satisfied with yourself
07/03/2019, 13:13 - Dikshita Kothari: You are not the judge of that

07/03/2019, 13:18 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm a liar

[3/9, 4:14 PM] Jenit Jain: Exactly. She embarrasses me in public Everytime. Saurak parth pranjal
[3/9, 4:14 PM] Jenit Jain: Why should I be at the receiving end of this everytime
[3/9, 4:15 PM] Divya M: But she just needs to change this
09/03/2019, 20:52 - Jenit Jain: So it's just not me
09/03/2019, 20:53 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita everyone knows you're the person whose fault it is
09/03/2019, 20:54 - Jenit Jain: I agree the decision making freedom is necessary, but if you take 1.5 years to say no (which you clearly didn't do as said by him) then I will do what's necessary. Moreover I told you everything I will do. You should be very fucking lucky I didn't beat him to pulp
09/03/2019, 20:54 - Jenit Jain: So be grateful
09/03/2019, 20:54 - Dikshita Kothari: I need time
09/03/2019, 20:54 - Jenit Jain: And if you think that this is the last time it's happening, don't fool yourself, next time I tell you something get it done according to your rules
09/03/2019, 20:54 - Jenit Jain: Otherwise I will intervene
09/03/2019, 20:54 - Jenit Jain: For what?
09/03/2019, 20:54 - Jenit Jain: Accept it?
09/03/2019, 20:55 - Dikshita Kothari: If everyone thinks I'm wrong then maybe I am
09/03/2019, 20:55 - Dikshita Kothari: But I've not understood how
09/03/2019, 20:55 - Dikshita Kothari: And I'm being able to understand the way you're telling
09/03/2019, 20:55 - Jenit Jain: Exactly what I'm trying to do baby
09/03/2019, 20:55 - Jenit Jain: Huh
09/03/2019, 20:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Not*
09/03/2019, 20:56 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm just saying
09/03/2019, 20:56 - Dikshita Kothari: You should've let me come to the conclusion on my own
09/03/2019, 20:56 - Dikshita Kothari: You can't help me everywhere
09/03/2019, 20:56 - Jenit Jain: Okay, then since you don't want to talk to my Bois so the only option you have is it accept it. You'll eventually get it. And then you'll know how to handle such situations in the future ( kill the problem in the womb before it becomes a big problem)
09/03/2019, 20:56 - Jenit Jain: Didn't really help you
09/03/2019, 20:56 - Jenit Jain: I helped me and the relationship
09/03/2019, 20:56 - Jenit Jain: That's why no regrets
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Dikshita Kothari: You're just being selfish
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Dikshita Kothari: It's fine
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm also being selfish
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Jenit Jain: Dikshitanyou ducking didn't come to a conclusion for 3 sems, you weren't going to come up with one now.
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Jenit Jain: And even if there was a conclusion to this, you wouldn't have applied it
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Jenit Jain: Because it fucking includes confrontay
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Jenit Jain: That you don't have the balls to do
09/03/2019, 20:57 - Jenit Jain: So you don't blame me
09/03/2019, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: You got a very good chance to handle it
09/03/2019, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: But "you never said" FUCKING  "no"
09/03/2019, 20:58 - Dikshita Kothari: I WILL DECIDE THAT NOT YOU ARE YOU STUPID
09/03/2019, 20:58 - Dikshita Kothari: You know I did
09/03/2019, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: Not clear enough, clearly since he had the balls to tell you directly
09/03/2019, 20:59 - Jenit Jain: Next time such a thing happens, know the background
09/03/2019, 20:59 - Jenit Jain: 1.5 years of liking is not healthy for me or relationship
09/03/2019, 20:59 - Jenit Jain: But I clearly remember you saying you're toh enjoying it because it's basically a compliment
09/03/2019, 20:59 - Jenit Jain: Next time you don't want to break friendships then don't "enjoy " pronlems
09/03/2019, 21:00 - Jenit Jain: You really should learn how to prioritize your life
09/03/2019, 21:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre exactly I don't care naaa I kept him as a friend and nothing more. Why will I go and stop people who compliment me. Jen you don't have to be so insecure.
09/03/2019, 21:02 - Jenit Jain: Yes and you don't have to be so open about other people liking you.
09/03/2019, 21:03 - Jenit Jain: I'll be insecure if I'm scared that you'll leave.
09/03/2019, 21:03 - Jenit Jain: Not when he flirts
09/03/2019, 21:03 - Jenit Jain: Please get your words correct.
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Dikshita Kothari: I'll not leave you know that
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Jenit Jain: Exactly
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Then why are you insecure
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Jenit Jain: .
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Dikshita Kothari: People will like me in the future
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Dikshita Kothari: What words
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Jenit Jain: You really never listen from your mistakes
09/03/2019, 21:04 - Jenit Jain: It's not insecure when I'm annoyed by the opposite person and not my gf
09/03/2019, 21:05 - Jenit Jain: And you'll again not tell them to be like bro back the fuck off
09/03/2019, 21:05 - Jenit Jain: And we'll have this problem again
09/03/2019, 21:05 - Jenit Jain: I've seen that you clearly never learn from your mistakes
09/03/2019, 21:05 - Jenit Jain: Definitely not going to get any easier with long distance.
09/03/2019, 21:05 - Jenit Jain: So dikshita you get balls
09/03/2019, 21:06 - Jenit Jain: And start being stern with the people who need to be stern with.
09/03/2019, 21:06 - Jenit Jain: And not the ones YOU THINK that need to be stern with
09/03/2019, 21:06 - Jenit Jain: Cos you clearly can't tell the difference
09/03/2019, 21:06 - Jenit Jain: So going back 1.5 years, this is all your fault.
09/03/2019, 21:07 - Jenit Jain: So while my relationship was getting affected for so much time you were having fun, and when o decide to alleviate my problem you're like wtf
09/03/2019, 21:07 - Jenit Jain: That's not how it works
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: What do you want from me ?
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: You tell me this full and final
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I know you don't want me to talk to Pranjal
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: And I spoke to him and told him everything I had to say and I have nothing else to say
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: So I have no business of talking to him anymore cause he's told me that he isn't going to get over me and I told him that if he doesn't then I can't even ask Jen to let me talk
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: That's why since morning
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: Whatever you said I agreed
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: But just asked for talking terms
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause throwing people out of my life I can't do
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: And I know how it feels if it's done to you
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I learnt this from Karan
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I know I'll never be happy if I do something like this
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: Why do you have such a big problem if I ended my memories with Pranjal on a good note instead of a bad one
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Jenit Jain: When did he say that
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Jenit Jain: You didn't tell me
09/03/2019, 21:08 - Dikshita Kothari: Yet I'm the one being screamed at and pushed and thrown around and asked to leave and whatnot. Aap seedhe muh se baat bhi nahi karte Jen. Aapka gussa is too much.
09/03/2019, 21:09 - Jenit Jain: Because you embarrassed me, yet again
09/03/2019, 21:10 - Jenit Jain: Cos you always keep my needs side Mai and usually do everything to piss me off while making sure that you will 100% not do what I ask you to do
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre if you had a problem and it was affecting you so much and since the beginning itself you should have removed it then itself like you did with Sanidhya. But no you let my friendship grow and then decided to hurt me so much. He was my best friend jenit. Not good
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: I will embarrass you again and again and again
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't let me talk I feel scared to talk when you're angry I forgot everything. I wasn't leaving cause I wasn't done with the convo
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: But no
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RN
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: Reminds you of some one ?
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: Agrim Sharma ?
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: I embarrassed you for my peace of mind
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: And I got it
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: You're being selfish af
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: So was I
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't think what I did made anything worse than it already is
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't speak to Arav Harshit cause you've already spoken to them
09/03/2019, 21:14 - Dikshita Kothari: It's not in my hand
09/03/2019, 21:15 - Jenit Jain: Okay I'll make a list. You star it and follow it.
1) if i ask you to not talk to someone, I've thought about it so that your tiny brain doesn't have to do anything.
2) remember that once I talk to the other person and tell them to stay away from you and you go and talk to them, IT FUCKING DESTROYS MY CREDIBILITY, IMAGE AND MODT OF ALL IT SHOWS OUTSIDERS AND ME HOW MUCH SHIT YOU GIVE ABOUT MY FEELINGS. 
3) I'm also tired of your delayed info. Why did you have to wait till we came till pp. You could have told me as soon as class got over. I need you to tell me asap. Not fuck around in between and then give bt. Country inn day also you waited till 10pm.
09/03/2019, 21:15 - Jenit Jain: Take that best friend and shove him in your arse then why don't you
09/03/2019, 21:16 - Jenit Jain: I didn't interfere BECAUSE YOU FUCKING TOLD ME YOULL HANDLE IT.
09/03/2019, 21:16 - Jenit Jain: Stop acting stupid, you know this is the reason.
09/03/2019, 21:16 - Jenit Jain: Only reason I interfered was because of your failure
09/03/2019, 21:16 - Jenit Jain: Never again. I. DARE. YOU.
09/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: HOW DARE YOU ASK ME TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN AFTER HIM SAYING HE'LL NEVER GET OVER YOU
09/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: You know how shitty that makes you sound
09/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: Filthy
09/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: Disgusting
09/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: Rubbish
09/03/2019, 21:17 - Jenit Jain: Exactly the words I'd use for your friendship with him as well
09/03/2019, 21:18 - Jenit Jain: Pure selfish.
09/03/2019, 21:18 - Dikshita Kothari: No I said I can't ask jenit to let me talk to you if you're not going to get over me
09/03/2019, 21:18 - Jenit Jain: We were happy for the past few days after you said fine I won't talk to him
09/03/2019, 21:18 - Dikshita Kothari: I couldn't do it
09/03/2019, 21:18 - Dikshita Kothari: What will you do
09/03/2019, 21:18 - Jenit Jain: Theyd explain the same things since you clearly don't understand my pov
09/03/2019, 21:19 - Dikshita Kothari: Repercussions in the relationship
09/03/2019, 21:19 - Jenit Jain: Take a break from a relationship next time you embarrass me.
09/03/2019, 21:19 - Dikshita Kothari: That's anyway happening
09/03/2019, 21:19 - Jenit Jain: Not counting fights.
09/03/2019, 21:19 - Dikshita Kothari: How will it become worse
09/03/2019, 21:19 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm taking a break now
09/03/2019, 21:19 - Dikshita Kothari: All you do is shout at me
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: But then you fucking kept asking me to let you talk to him
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: Greay
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I said talking terms
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: So next time I'll directly break up. Good.
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: Nothing doing.
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Dikshita Kothari: So easy Jen
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: You do such things
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: No
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Dikshita Kothari: So easy for you to say that
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: But necessary
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: Saying is easy doing is hard but will be necessary
09/03/2019, 21:20 - Dikshita Kothari: Did you expect me to find it easy to give up a friendship
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Jenit Jain: Otherwise you'll just take advantage of me every step of the way to get your way
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Jenit Jain: No
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Your definition of necessary I've seen
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Jenit Jain: But your own fault
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Jenit Jain: Don't blame me for jack shit
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay jenit
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Guess what
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Jenit Jain: Okay.
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Everything is my fault
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Jenit Jain: True
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I take full responsibility for it
09/03/2019, 21:21 - Jenit Jain: Shove that sarcasm up your arse next to pranjal
09/03/2019, 21:23 - Jenit Jain: You haven't even owned up to a single thing since this thing started. Or even in the past. Sharam rakho
09/03/2019, 21:23 - Jenit Jain: Reply
09/03/2019, 21:25 - Jenit Jain: Also you got a fair turn when we sat outside. So don't give me any of this not being able to complete bs
09/03/2019, 21:25 - Jenit Jain: So dikshita all this hiding and all, I have no patience nor time for it
09/03/2019, 21:28 - Dikshita Kothari: .
09/03/2019, 21:28 - Dikshita Kothari: What you want me to own up to ?

2. Stfu 
3. Stfu
09/03/2019, 21:28 - Jenit Jain: Not negotiable
09/03/2019, 21:28 - Jenit Jain: All the times you've embarrassed me, all times you were wrong and still fought about it like this one.
09/03/2019, 21:29 - Jenit Jain: Agree to this or we're done here.
09/03/2019, 21:29 - Dikshita Kothari: 1. I will decide if to follow or not 
2. What's my image in front of anyone Jen ? Nothing. Absolutely. I don't want to destroy your credibility. But you legit don't give me an option. You have to give me an option not an ultimatum or a blackmail ka thing. 
3. Always remember. You told me about the somiya thing after everything was over. 
Also I told you late cause I know you'd react like this and I was contemplating whether to tell you or not. But then I felt too guilty and had to tell.
09/03/2019, 21:29 - Dikshita Kothari: I give bt
09/03/2019, 21:30 - Dikshita Kothari: You give me more bt

09/03/2019, 21:30 - Jenit Jain: Sorry for coming in your life
09/03/2019, 21:30 - Jenit Jain: .
09/03/2019, 21:31 - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't even had to handle one person's emotions let alone 2
09/03/2019, 21:31 - Dikshita Kothari: And now I have to see for 3 people and all of those as well who I will embarrass you in front of
09/03/2019, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: Moreover, somiya thing yes. I will own up to everything because I fucked up. Yes I told you after it's over. Mainly because I didn't know what exactly to say. We were pretty clueless ourselves
09/03/2019, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: .
09/03/2019, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: .
09/03/2019, 21:32 - Jenit Jain: .

09/03/2019, 21:33 - Dikshita Kothari: .
09/03/2019, 21:33 - Jenit Jain: No I'd like to take a break from our relationship to gather my thoughts about you not doing things that I REALLY need in my relationship.
09/03/2019, 21:33 - Jenit Jain: What about this man
09/03/2019, 21:33 - Dikshita Kothari: I'll never forget this

09/03/2019, 21:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Let's take a break then
09/03/2019, 21:34 - Jenit Jain: Middle of the fight you start laughing and using sarcasm what else you'll get?
09/03/2019, 21:34 - Dikshita Kothari: I wasn't being sarcastic
09/03/2019, 21:34 - Jenit Jain: Are you sure you're not going to follow these 3 rules then?
09/03/2019, 21:34 - Jenit Jain: You don't accept anything.

In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

16/03/2019, 18:33 - Jenit Jain: Respected Sir/ Ma'am,
I'm Jenit Jain, studying in my 3rd year of Computer Science and Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology.
I was intrigued by your company and I would love to be a part of your team.
I have been studying Artificial intelligence since my first year and haven't looked back. I have implemented several algorithms with success, have past experience working with LSTM and CNN models, did an internship where I was responsible for building models to solve problems related to computer vision and automating tasks by extracting information through data mining. I'm also working towards a minor in Intelligent Systems.
I would be obliged if I get an opportunity to work with your company and help build real life solutions.
Thank you.

20/03/2019, 21:20 - Jenit Jain: If you're shameless enough
20/03/2019, 21:20 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay then leave it

20/03/2019, 21:39 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't understand
20/03/2019, 21:39 - Jenit Jain: And you were acting fake all this time by pretending that you understood the entire thing. I'm sure if I hadn't broken my hand you would still be adamant about what ever shit you did
20/03/2019, 21:40 - Dikshita Kothari: I said I'm fine with what you decided
20/03/2019, 21:40 - Jenit Jain: Myself raho. Par significant logo ka bhi soch lo kabhi

29/03/2019, 17:14 - Dikshita Kothari: [29/03, 5:06 PM] Papa: No one wants you to be hassled . 
The airline must have changed to this option as the best option available else why would they trouble you . 
Further now situation is such that Jet Airways and Spice Jet many aircrafts have been grounded due to defects in their Boeing airline. 
So be happy that you reached and you will reach Chennai safely else nowadays Jet does not even inform cancellation of flight . 
We are booked while returning in Jet . I am apprehensive about this and have taken indigo as optional also as I need to reach Kolkata on 6th being first day of Navratri
[29/03, 5:07 PM] Dikshita Kothari: I don't know where to file customer complaints otherwise I would've given them a piece of my mind 
This is absolutely nonsensical 
I have checked already there are other flights with less flying time. Simply they're doing this.
[29/03, 5:09 PM] Papa: You find out and tell me I will raise the issue if so . 
Find out now and tell me if there is a connecting flight Indigo or spice or any other without change that takes you to Chennai in less time
29/03/2019, 17:19 - Jenit Jain: Now not possible
29/03/2019, 17:20 - Jenit Jain: Too late

No road is long with good company.  And difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. It was a long drive but worth it. 

We are settled comfortably in our rooms. Our resort is very picturesque -  spacious log cottages skewed around a giant lawn.  I'm sharing a room with Krishiv and Samriddh. Krishiv has finished his scrap book work for the day and is exploring  the WiFi password of the resort. Samriddh is giving the finishing touches. 

We had a yummy lunch at Pizza Hut. On the bus we caught up on our beauty sleep. And then we played games - 
Volleyball without a ball
Two truths and one lie! 
Head Up Vocal
Heads Up Actions

Manasvi and Kanishk were jammed plenty. 

Yana is the captain of the team 'The Order of the Phonix' and Meghomala is heading 'The Superiors'. 

The day belonged to the Order. But tomorrow is another day. 

All the kids have downloaded the App Your hour to track their phone usage. Three of the older, prettier, more handsome young adults(names withheld on request) who had more than 3 1/2 hours online logs have been punished. They will be the water carriers tomorrow when we scale the daunting Lion Rock. 

Meghomala and Krishiv won the prizes for being the lightest travellers. On a long journey, even a feather weighs like stone. I can't wait to hear the water carriers' experiences tomorrow! 

Tomorrow's plan is 6, 7 and 8 am. 

Powerpacks devoured, Dinner ingested.  Lying like sloths in our Travelicious t-shirts. Savouring the day gone by. 

I'm already beginning to trust this journey. 

Until tomorrow...
Shhhh.....
Samriddh is snoozing.

Animals are such agreeable friends - they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms. 

But what if the animal is a 6 ft long, fat python! 

We had many close, wild encounters today. As we ascended the Lion Rock, a monkey made off with Yana's Tang. Later, we chanced upon the Kingdom of Monkeys but couldn't retrieve the lost belongings. A swarm of bumble bees hovered at a safe distance. We were asked to speak in hushed tones, lest we attract their attention. Dogs followed us in the hope of getting scraps from the lip-smacking power packs. A giant python slid across the kids' shoulders and necks. A cobra danced for the kids' cameras with it's hood open and left the kids spell bound. A tusker elephant stood patiently on the roadside allowing our bus to pass. A herd of deer gambolled amongst the Polonnaruwa ruins. A most unexpected visitor during dinner was a majestic owl and we went click click again. 

Meghomala has a way with dogs. They listen to her. Watching her, I realized that until one had loved an animal, a part of the soul remains unawakened. Krishiv video chats with his dog everyday. 

But the heroes of the day were Palakh and Jayesh. They sailed through the MasterChef and JAM challenges admirably. For a debut, their corn bhel was so authentic, it would have put Bombay Shiv Sagar to shame. 

After three UNESCO world heritage sites, the body was tired. But we decided to swim with our hearts. Muskan, Manasvi and Yana are ace swimmers, their strokes decisive and fluid. They won every race. 

Phone usage has dropped drastically from an average of 3 1/2 hours to 37 minutes. Perhaps, corporal punishment does reform. But the winner was Samriddh who refused to talk to his mother lest his phone show a shameful log entry. 

The Superiors won 'Mind Boggling Lateral Thinking'.  But tomorrow is another day. 

I'm sure everyone is dreaming of elephants at the moment. 

Shhhh.....

Punctuality is the courtesy of Kings. Eight girls couldn't keep to the 6-7-8 am time schedule this morning and were punished. They were made to dance for the more punctilious. 

But it takes all kinds to make the world an interesting place. 

We visited the Millennium Elephant Foundation, the Iswarya Ayurvedic Spice Garden and relished an ethnic 
cultural show at Kandy theatre. Thereafter, we were transported in a shuttle to the magnificent Serendip Stone Bungalow. A swim and a sumptuous dinner were followed by filing away  memories for retrieval at a later date and a strategy game of Battleships. 

All in a day's work. 

I'm privileged to be the raconteur of our adventures but nothing I write will do justice to today's experiences. They were incredible.  

Besides,  a video is worth a thousand words. 

Be punctual please. We'll find a way to reprimand you but we cannot recycle the wasted time ever. 

Blessed....

I apologise for missing the deadline last evening. But I was 'spooked' out of my wits and too petrified to string a coherent sentence together. Some children narrated frightening tales around a flickering candle in a wooden attic while other young rascals provided sound effects and special effects. I was completely unnerved. 

Yesterday, we found ourselves improvising all day. How can an adventure be a planned itinerary anyway!? The visit to the Blue Tea Factory went as per plan. The heart of tea is in the plucking and the soul of tea is in the steeping. The children learnt all this and more. 

Thereafter, an unplanned,  strenuous  hike led us to the Ramboda waterfall. We took a bath in it, at least the more daring ones did while the others watched and grappled with their diffidence and fears. I must mention Aanya here. She is doing something everyday that hitherto scared her. A mind stretched by new experiences cannot return to it's old dimensions. Aanya is a wondrous wonder everyday! Some complained of the moss, others of  the rocks hurting their feet. But the waterfall wouldn't sound as melodious if there weren't rocks in it's bed. All in all, everyone was delighted and wet without a change handy! 

Cycling at Nuwara Eliya was a spur of the moment decision too. The lake was shimmering. The tudor style cottages were bellowing smoke from their chimneys. The twilight was casting long shadows on the turf. The setting sun was outlining the clouds with silver linings. We chose to cycle a 5 km circuit and savour it all. One just can't be sad while riding a bike. All the riders returned grinning from ear to ear. 

In the meantime, the chefs of the day -  Bhanvi, Meghomala and Vanshika made assorted sandwiches that looked lavish and tasted sumptuous. What culinary connoisseurs!!! They were completely sold out and the kids were begging for more. 

We can proceed according to a planned itinerary strenuously trying to make life confirm to it's needs or we can adapt to whatever we meet and flow without effort. 

We chose the latter. 

Yesterday we heard the waterfall and birds and winds sing. 

Today the song of the waves is lulling us to sleep.

There is magic on this planet and it is contained in water. Little wonder why we immerse ourselves everyday. 

Rafting appears to be an adventure sport. We did chance the rapids and dance the tides.  But to us, it's a team building exercise too. The boat won't go if we all don't row together. So everytime the navigator yelled an instruction - "forward', "backward', "relax', "down"....we acted as one unit in perfect sync and harmony. For a while I watched Kanishk, Yana and Krishiv seated on my starboard side,  bang their oars and blame each other. But after only one heart-in-the-mouth rapid, the three stopped bickering and rowed better than the participants of Kerala's snake boat races. 

Alka facilitated a module on effective verbal and non-verbal communication skills. Through a fun game, she demonstrated how distortions occur and the message is lost. 

No sooner did we check into the Long Beach resort, than we changed and rushed to enjoy sea-bathing. The light was fast  failing and our time was marked. So we made the most of it albeit time moves differently at the beach. It doesn't move hour to hour, but mood to moment. Krishiv got a sound scolding for forgetting that he was human and not a merman. 

When the sun set in the distant horizon, the water babies made their way to the colossal swimming pool and played a tough match of water polo. 

At 7.30 pm the kids left to change into their party pants and LBDs. The hair gels and blush ons were brought out. The shirts were ironed and ironed again. One by one, the transformed princes and princesses assembled at the lobby all set to party. Alas, I can't tell you more. 

What happened at the Long Beach shall stay at the Long Beach. 

No one looks back at their life and remembers the nights they had plenty of sleep. Crazy nights make the best memories.

Deficit on sleep, surplus on memories...

A world without whales and dolphins wouldn't be much of a world at all. When you see them on TV, you're seeing close ups of these massive creatures and the music that's added gives you a certain feeling. In reality, the kids had partied late into the night and had barely shut eye when they were hauled out of bed and put on a boat that was bobbing up and down. They felt sick and the whale wasn't there on demand. They were forced to wash down an Avomine with tea/coffee that would keep the hangover and retching at bay. 

They were almost zoning out again when a gam of whales and a pod of dolphins stopped by to say hello. And then they were animated. Their souls and spirits took flight.

Alas, the Avomine had them under it's spell and they went through half the day in a trance. Doped and drugged,  they sleep walked through the Fort of Galle, a UNESCO world heritage site. 

Dr. Vidushi advised plenty of food and water. So by lunch time, they were more in their elements. 

But what truly jolted them awake was the boat cruise in a mangrove forest, the exotic  cinnamon island and the fish spa. Then there were squeals and screams so loud,  that all the black monkeys and cranes in the neighborhood were startled. Everyone yelled but 
Dikshita and Manasvi's shrieks had our ears ringing. Perhaps they'll win awards today for their caterwauls. 

The kids were sensitised to the plight of the turtles. And when they got to pet and love the hatchlings and the disabled ones, the bond was sealed forever. 

The kids were under the weather all day. Sanya succumbed and threw up in her vomit bag. Smart girl! 

But ask them, ' Whale you do it again? '

' Dolphinately!!!!! '

03/05/2019, 17:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Not affecting you or me
03/05/2019, 17:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Who tf am I supposed to talk to in class.
03/05/2019, 17:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Selfish
03/05/2019, 17:37 - Jenit Jain: I've told you it was affecting me
03/05/2019, 17:38 - Dikshita Kothari: How
03/05/2019, 17:38 - Dikshita Kothari: It's no point talking to you man
03/05/2019, 17:38 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't understand anything
03/05/2019, 17:38 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita after somiya even I had to make friends in class. Divya has been in my class since sem 1 and I still started talking to her in this semester
03/05/2019, 17:38 - Dikshita Kothari: That was your fault
03/05/2019, 17:38 - Dikshita Kothari: You liked her
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Dikshita Kothari: And went on dates and all
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: So yes you should have friends is my point
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Dikshita Kothari: While we were dating
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: Fuck you
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: Fo you too much
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: I asked you for jogs
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Dikshita Kothari: Did you not
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: Everytime
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: NO
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: Fuck you now
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: Bye
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Dikshita Kothari: Cycling trips in the morning ?
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe Siddharth was right
03/05/2019, 17:39 - Dikshita Kothari: I should've given you more bt about that
03/05/2019, 17:49 - Jenit Jain: Do you still want to give me bt? You didn't give me bt thank you. But I didn't take it lightly either, I didn't make any contact . Over here, you know how affected I got by him and for so long you let it go on and didnt care for my feelings. And now you're bringing it up again which says you clearly still care which hurts me more.
03/05/2019, 17:49 - Jenit Jain: So sorry if you think you're going to talk to him again. Because that's not happening
03/05/2019, 17:53 - Jenit Jain: ?
03/05/2019, 17:55 - Jenit Jain: What
03/05/2019, 17:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre but you liked her and she liked you back na. Even then I knew that our relationship was more important than a stupid crush. Why can't you see that now? Don't you understand me? I don't make friends that easily and now that I did you just went and removed them from my life which btw you had no authority to do. You didn't get affected at all. Acha and while we're on that topic how many times have I told you to not smoke did you listen even once. It's been bothering me also. It's not like I took the pot and flushed it down a toilet. I'm bringing it up again because I care obviously. It shouldn't hurt you it should show that I really need you to be okay with it. Jen honestly it's not even your place to say anything and if it was someone else they would've spoken also by now. I don't know when what happened that now I have to ask your permission to do anything. And this anything isn't even wrong. Acha leave me let's talk about what you're saying. Affecting you this that bullshit it was affecting you. You know what's happening is that it's affecting you now. 6 months is a long time Jen. 
I can't be content with my life I can't keep you happy cause of my thoughts . No one is happy with what you did
03/05/2019, 17:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Are you really saying that we as a couple are in a better place now than January? And if you are then I'm sorry but you and I are in two very different places.
03/05/2019, 17:58 - Jenit Jain: Who are 'them' I took from your life man. Start naming.
03/05/2019, 17:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Dude all of them
03/05/2019, 17:59 - Dikshita Kothari: Is it because you have a problem with me making guy friends ?
03/05/2019, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: All relationships have ups and downs. I have been distant this sem because of the marriage and then this fracture
03/05/2019, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: I had to focus on other too
03/05/2019, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: Name no
03/05/2019, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: Other things*
03/05/2019, 18:00 - Jenit Jain: If they are decent or at least keep you safe, what problem will I have
03/05/2019, 18:01 - Dikshita Kothari: You have to focus on everything else did you even once think about me ? I told you longggggg back I won't move out. Who am I supposed to chill with when you're busy. What do you want me to be at your beck and call at all times that toh anyway I am na jen. What do you want from me I toh still can't understand
03/05/2019, 18:01 - Dikshita Kothari: They kept me happy and I felt good to chill with people who didn't judge
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Dikshita Kothari: All the people I called for my bday dinner to meet Mom minus the girls and Kshitij Shashank Sanidhya
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Jenit Jain: Dude if they left because you stopped talking to 1 guy, then it's not my fault that they didn't think of you as important enough. Why do you want them to be so important if they don't give a shit about you
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause it's bro code and you know it don't give me stupid reasons
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Jenit Jain: And who are those people you name man.
03/05/2019, 18:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Akshat Pranjal Rudraksh Jayant Rishabh
03/05/2019, 18:03 - Jenit Jain: Umm not really. If everyone is friends it's not a problem. Bro code comes if you're an ex you stupid girl
03/05/2019, 18:03 - Jenit Jain: 4 people who at least thought you weren't important enough, not my fault
03/05/2019, 18:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Why would they talk to me after you insulted their best friend
03/05/2019, 18:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Do you think I'm important enough for you ?
03/05/2019, 18:04 - Jenit Jain: And they saw how I cordial was with them so yeah this
03/05/2019, 18:04 - Jenit Jain: Yes baby

03/05/2019, 18:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Most is only one
03/05/2019, 18:05 - Dikshita Kothari: One of the most doesn't make sense
03/05/2019, 18:05 - Jenit Jain: One of the more important people ever???

03/05/2019, 18:07 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't ever be happy after making someone sad
03/05/2019, 18:07 - Dikshita Kothari: It happened with Nethraa also I felt guilty for some 2 months and now it's happening again
03/05/2019, 18:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't deal with it and I don't like it
03/05/2019, 18:08 - Dikshita Kothari: And you shouldn't try to change me to fit your needs
03/05/2019, 18:08 - Jenit Jain: Don't keep saying thag

03/05/2019, 18:09 - Jenit Jain: Lol
03/05/2019, 18:09 - Dikshita Kothari: Do you have a problem with that also ?
03/05/2019, 18:11 - Jenit Jain: I feel very sad when you ask me if you can go chill with class people also. I've told you that you have to update me that you're going somewhere not ask for permission
03/05/2019, 18:11 - Jenit Jain: Matlab tumko stay over karna hai ya nahi
03/05/2019, 18:12 - Dikshita Kothari: I'll sneak in from the back
03/05/2019, 18:12 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Jen update

03/05/2019, 18:12 - Jenit Jain: Good
03/05/2019, 18:13 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm going to apologise for my behaviour because I think I was very wrong to hurt someone so much. And then if possible I will try to make friends again. Please be okay with it. It's just one semester. Please jen.
03/05/2019, 18:13 - Dikshita Kothari: Like I did with Nethraa
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: Don't apologise and please make friends

03/05/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: Pranjal ke alava baat karona sabse
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have so much strength to lose so many people
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: Didn't you say you won't even talk to these people
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Dikshita Kothari: Nahi kar raha koi mujhse baat pehle jaise Jen.
03/05/2019, 18:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Kya ?
03/05/2019, 18:15 - Jenit Jain: Sad luck
03/05/2019, 18:15 - Jenit Jain: To your class people after manipal
03/05/2019, 18:18 - Dikshita Kothari: I had so many friends for the first time in my life and you selfish person legit removed everyone with one swipe. My mom was so happy when she came she said wah finally you made new friends. First year ka group ka 4 people are left. But that okay I understand there were reasons yahan koi reason nahi hai babu pls. And haan I probably won't talk to anyone after Manipal is over but at least let me enjoy it while it is. Koi itna nahi poochta Jen. I'm asking cause it's important for me to feel good about myself again. I can't go through summer vacation knowing that there are so many things I can save.
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita this is too much begging
03/05/2019, 18:18 - Dikshita Kothari: Why is it so difficult for you to give me what I want? First of all I don't even know why your permission is needed but I'm asking then also.
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: I don't like it
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Dikshita Kothari: You're making me beg
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: Wah thanks mam
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't say anything rude in this
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Dikshita Kothari: It's all fact
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: I don't even know what to say
03/05/2019, 18:19 - Jenit Jain: Why are you falling to such a level
03/05/2019, 18:20 - Jenit Jain: Don't say I'm forcing and shit
03/05/2019, 18:20 - Jenit Jain: That's bs
03/05/2019, 18:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you it'll be better for both of us also if I have others to chill with.
03/05/2019, 18:20 - Dikshita Kothari: No it's really not
03/05/2019, 18:21 - Jenit Jain: Why can't you past fight be. Everytime I tell you to clear after a fight you say yeah everything's fine or you yourself say that let's not talk about it, fuck it. And then you bring allll the shit again
03/05/2019, 18:21 - Dikshita Kothari: It's actually become impossible for me to do anything I want. Simply all the time I'm thinking that if jenit gets too angry he's again going to break his hand
03/05/2019, 18:21 - Jenit Jain: I'm not
03/05/2019, 18:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Because I'm trying to let go but I can't
03/05/2019, 18:21 - Dikshita Kothari: If not yours someone else's

03/05/2019, 18:22 - Jenit Jain: Might
03/05/2019, 18:22 - Dikshita Kothari: That's the thing I don't want to learn all these bad things
03/05/2019, 18:23 - Jenit Jain: Okay
03/05/2019, 18:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Why can't you understand I think it's going to be better for both of us as well. I told you na we're not in the same place as we used to be in the beginning of the semester. Try to understand what I'm saying and let me fix it my way
03/05/2019, 18:23 - Dikshita Kothari: You're acting like a male chauvinist pig Jen
03/05/2019, 18:24 - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message

04/05/2019, 12:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I've been sitting awhile on this window seat with it smooth polished wooden top, close to the window.  The pot plants have been quivering plenty but  holding their perch. The trees beyond have been swaying dangerously but holding their own too. Wood is resilient, priceless in it's ageing and forever young, capable of being born a hundred times. Tiny rivulets have formed on the window panes distorting my view of the world. I have left the window a little ajar to feel the cold spray on my cheek and hand whenever the wind wills it. Storm or no storm, the city's rites of dawn must be underway. Newspaper boys must wheel past and toss their rolls. Milkmen, on cycles, their large tin cans clanging, must  ring door bells. The brisk, bowlegged, old men and women who work their arms as if dragging back their youth must be up and wonder what to do. On a clear day, boy servants take out the dogs of their masters. The dogs must be restlessly scraping at their front doors.  
The peril is almost passed. Man will bury and leave behind loss, sorrow, failure, misery and deprivation. If man didn't know this routine, he'd be so roasted and weighted, he couldn't move a single step. 
So let's talk of oases with springs of sherbet and doe-eyed houris...
It's a survival tool. It's a life skill.

06/05/2019, 00:15 - Jenit Jain: Lol if they consider you that
06/05/2019, 00:15 - Dikshita Kothari: That's very toxic
06/05/2019, 00:15 - Jenit Jain: It's either this or me telling you what to do. You're clearly tired of the latter so it's fine I'll handle the toxicity
06/05/2019, 00:16 - Jenit Jain: That's what I get from my girlfriend
06/05/2019, 00:16 - Jenit Jain: So I'll take that
06/05/2019, 00:18 - Dikshita Kothari: You shouldn't hurt people who care about you jenit. You know it's a delicate topic. In front of you I cried for hours about it. And you're bringing it up so lightly. Thanks Jen I appreciate it. And no that's not what you get from your girlfriend. I will not be ordered around and I don't need your permission to do things. I'm so tired of this bs
06/05/2019, 00:18 - Jenit Jain: Even I'm tired. So how about you stick to your free will and I'll stick to the toxicity? Atleast it works for you
06/05/2019, 00:18 - Jenit Jain: So it shouldn't a problem
06/05/2019, 00:19 - Jenit Jain: At least you'll start feeling like January again
06/05/2019, 00:19 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to make any sacrifices for me and I don't want to make any for you either
06/05/2019, 00:19 - Jenit Jain: Okay then
06/05/2019, 00:19 - Jenit Jain: I will remember that
06/05/2019, 00:19 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
06/05/2019, 00:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't say anything wrong
06/05/2019, 00:20 - Jenit Jain: But real nature after 4 years of relationship no
06/05/2019, 00:20 - Jenit Jain: 3*
06/05/2019, 00:20 - Dikshita Kothari: It was always this

06/05/2019, 00:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not the one who's changed
06/05/2019, 00:21 - Jenit Jain: Cool
06/05/2019, 00:21 - Jenit Jain: Anything more you want to blame me for?
06/05/2019, 00:22 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't blame you for anything
06/05/2019, 00:22 - Jenit Jain: LOLLK

06/05/2019, 00:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Do you want me to stay over tomorrow or no?
06/05/2019, 00:23 - Jenit Jain: You blame me for everything
06/05/2019, 00:23 - Jenit Jain: Listen you're not doing me a favor
06/05/2019, 00:23 - Dikshita Kothari: No I'm asking you

06/05/2019, 00:23 - Jenit Jain: Again, do whatever you want
06/05/2019, 00:24 - Jenit Jain: I'm tired of your class bs.

06/05/2019, 00:26 - Jenit Jain: Then have some self respect and not go where you're not wanted
06/05/2019, 00:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Why don't you understand
06/05/2019, 00:26 - Dikshita Kothari: I wasn't brought up like that
06/05/2019, 00:27 - Jenit Jain: Not brought up to have self respect?
06/05/2019, 00:27 - Dikshita Kothari: Not brought up to leave things in such a bad place for three months
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Jenit Jain: Who are you to decide if they are in a bad place.
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Jenit Jain: Clearly it's affecting only you
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm in a bad place
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Dikshita Kothari: Exactly
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Jenit Jain: Which makes only you stupid
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I know what to do to make myself feel better
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Dikshita Kothari: You had your way the entire semester
06/05/2019, 00:28 - Dikshita Kothari: It's my turn now
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Jenit Jain: Oh shut up
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: And that's final
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: You shut up
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: You let me know if you want me to come or not
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: To hepta
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: To pl
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: Pp *;
06/05/2019, 00:29 - Dikshita Kothari: Just let me know Jen
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Jenit Jain: You leave it be dikshita. You fucked up initially by not talking my advice and keeping your friendship under control. I told you billion times to stop it. You always said you would handle it. Instead you didn't do jackshiy. And if I'm right, you loved the idea of people having a crush on you. Then when that back fired you started blaming me for everything
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Jenit Jain: You tell me first why didn't you do anything to stop it for 1.5 years
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Dikshita Kothari: I told him I didn't like him
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Jenit Jain: Even your mom says you could have been more stern
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Dikshita Kothari: And that's it
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Dikshita Kothari: The rest is not my business
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Jenit Jain: So now face the consequences
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Jenit Jain: Great
06/05/2019, 00:31 - Dikshita Kothari: No I will not
06/05/2019, 00:32 - Dikshita Kothari: You can't give me consequences
06/05/2019, 00:32 - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't done anything wrong and I know it
06/05/2019, 00:32 - Dikshita Kothari: You're the one who's too insecure to see your mistake
06/05/2019, 00:32 - Jenit Jain: Tumhara accha hai. When is time for you to enjoy all this bs then you'll have time if your life. When it comes to bite you, it was never your fault? Wahhh
06/05/2019, 00:33 - Jenit Jain: Neither insecure nor mistaken
06/05/2019, 00:33 - Dikshita Kothari: What came to bite me? From where I'm standing it was you Jen
06/05/2019, 00:33 - Jenit Jain: I'm not taking the blame for anything
06/05/2019, 00:33 - Jenit Jain: The facts dikshita the facts
06/05/2019, 00:33 - Dikshita Kothari: You have caused me so much pain this semester k I will never forget it
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Dikshita Kothari: What do I do with your facts
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Jenit Jain: Me too
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Dikshita Kothari: You're the one who hurt me
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Jenit Jain: Shove it up
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Dikshita Kothari: If this is the way you talk to your gf
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Jenit Jain: Sure I was toh having the time of my life
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Jenit Jain: Then what
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Just drama for no reason
06/05/2019, 00:34 - Dikshita Kothari: I was so happy
06/05/2019, 00:35 - Dikshita Kothari: Is*
06/05/2019, 00:35 - Jenit Jain: You really should have handled it in the 3-4th semester
06/05/2019, 00:35 - Jenit Jain: You don't crib now
06/05/2019, 00:35 - Dikshita Kothari: You just shut up
06/05/2019, 00:35 - Dikshita Kothari: You cannot interfere
06/05/2019, 00:35 - Dikshita Kothari: It's not your place
06/05/2019, 00:36 - Jenit Jain: I didn't for the longest time
06/05/2019, 00:36 - Jenit Jain: Be grateful
06/05/2019, 00:36 - Dikshita Kothari: And even now it's not your place Jen
06/05/2019, 00:36 - Jenit Jain: And when it affected me by annoying me beyond a threshold, then yeah it is my problem
06/05/2019, 00:36 - Jenit Jain: And I solved it
06/05/2019, 00:36 - Dikshita Kothari: This message was deleted
06/05/2019, 00:37 - Jenit Jain: You give me one good reason of not handling long ago
06/05/2019, 00:37 - Jenit Jain: It's neither of our faults that he didn't stop liking you. But I'm very sure if you had made any effort he would have stopped.
06/05/2019, 00:37 - Jenit Jain: Moreover, you didn't want him yo stop liking you. You like fans I know
06/05/2019, 00:38 - Jenit Jain: So stfu
06/05/2019, 00:38 - Jenit Jain: Stop putting this shit on me
06/05/2019, 00:38 - Jenit Jain: Your unhappiness is your long time coming undoing
06/05/2019, 00:41 - Jenit Jain: Could you type any slowet
06/05/2019, 00:44 - Dikshita Kothari: My handling is different from your handling. 
It was just annoying you but your stupidity this semester has made me so angry and so sad that I don't even recognise myself anymore. Do you remember what I was in first semester. That's who you liked and that's who I want to be. You're just not letting me be that person. When some situations are delicate handling is just giving the person some time to get over it. When he got a no from my side he never bothered me about it again. I never even heard or thought that he still liked me. He was doing absolutely nothing except helping me adjust in class. And you went and told him that he was harassing me. You keep saying I embarrassed you jenit. Do you know how much you've embarrassed me? That too in front of my class people. Now I'm just that girl who's life is handled by her bf. You made my life difficult in my place of work/study and that's just not acceptable to me. If you can't not interfere in my work life then you should just not hear about it cause I won't tell you anything. My head must be bonkers to feel so guilty all the time. I should've known that if people don't understand some things, those things just shouldn't be shared with them.
06/05/2019, 00:46 - Jenit Jain: Wow
06/05/2019, 00:46 - Jenit Jain: What about the million gifts
06/05/2019, 00:47 - Jenit Jain: Do you think that's okay for me!
06/05/2019, 00:47 - Dikshita Kothari: Last semester even for your friends I was dikshita and now I'm just another girl right... I just don't fit the bill anymore. I'm trying to get myself back to that. If you can't support me then idk what you're doing.
06/05/2019, 00:47 - Jenit Jain: Fine I don't share
06/05/2019, 00:47 - Dikshita Kothari: What million gifts ???
06/05/2019, 00:47 - Jenit Jain: Teddy's chocolates and bs
06/05/2019, 00:47 - Jenit Jain: Who the fuck gives a teddy
06/05/2019, 00:47 - Jenit Jain: Fuck you
06/05/2019, 00:48 - Jenit Jain: They toh consider you as part of their group
06/05/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Teddy was fourth Sem
06/05/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Chocolates was for my bday
06/05/2019, 00:48 - Jenit Jain: Vidit got supplies for you from Dubai but nevermind
06/05/2019, 00:48 - Jenit Jain: I'm telling you since before that only please let it be
06/05/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so sorry I don't feel like I deserve it anymore
06/05/2019, 00:48 - Jenit Jain: Good burn it
06/05/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: The supplies?
06/05/2019, 00:49 - Jenit Jain: He got chocolates and all for you separately
06/05/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: That's very sweet
06/05/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't deserve it
06/05/2019, 00:49 - Jenit Jain: Okay
06/05/2019, 00:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't deserve any of it
06/05/2019, 00:49 - Jenit Jain: No one will get
06/05/2019, 00:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Jen see the thing is
06/05/2019, 00:50 - Dikshita Kothari: If I can't get myself together I don't ever be able to fix our relationship
06/05/2019, 00:51 - Dikshita Kothari: I know what I need to do to get my shit together
06/05/2019, 00:51 - Dikshita Kothari: If you can, please support
06/05/2019, 00:51 - Jenit Jain: Every time one thing only you have to sah
06/05/2019, 00:51 - Jenit Jain: This is how you blackmail
06/05/2019, 00:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Let me get all situations back to how they were last sem
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I did so well I never thought I'd get a 9.5 + Jen but I did
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I was doing well
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Why won't you let me get back to that
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Jenit Jain: I'm sorry for fucking it all up dikshita
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not blackmailing you
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Jenit Jain: And why are we even arguing
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you the truth
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Jenit Jain: I've already told you do what you want man
06/05/2019, 00:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm telling you what I feel
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even want to hear
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Jenit Jain: I've heard it before
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Dikshita Kothari: But you just don't care it is
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Jenit Jain: For your class "friends", no I don't
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Jenit Jain: Do what you want
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Jenit Jain: I'm sleeping
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes I will
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Dikshita Kothari: Good night
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Jenit Jain: I can't be bothered with this shit anymore
06/05/2019, 00:53 - Jenit Jain: Gn
06/05/2019, 00:54 - Dikshita Kothari: I wish you would've never been bothered by it cause it was none of your business
06/05/2019, 00:54 - Jenit Jain: Until you let it GET OUT OF PROPORTION AND IT STARTED TO AFFECT ME
06/05/2019, 00:55 - Dikshita Kothari: It was same as last sem and the sem before
06/05/2019, 00:55 - Jenit Jain: Im sorry your friends don't think you're important enough. Just don't blame me because I'm not taking shit :)
06/05/2019, 00:55 - Jenit Jain: Piling up
06/05/2019, 00:55 - Dikshita Kothari: My friends have no relation to you
06/05/2019, 00:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Look at how you're cornering me
06/05/2019, 00:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Think of yourself in my situation
06/05/2019, 00:56 - Dikshita Kothari: You selfish boy
06/05/2019, 00:56 - Jenit Jain: You still haven't even said why you didn't make sure it stopped. But like you said, you just told him you didn't like him. Should be enough. Then again your mother said the same thing that you should have made it clear to him. But eh who am I to judge. Especially considering the fact that he himself said you never said no to him so he continued liking.
06/05/2019, 00:57 - Jenit Jain: Maybe it's all your fault that you got too happy of having followers
06/05/2019, 00:57 - Jenit Jain: I wouldnt get in your situation because I have my priorities clear
06/05/2019, 00:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya right. At least think before you type nonsense
06/05/2019, 00:58 - Jenit Jain: You've said something along those lines
06/05/2019, 00:59 - Jenit Jain: Weren't you just too happy that so many people had a crush on you
06/05/2019, 00:59 - Jenit Jain: I think you were
06/05/2019, 00:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I wasn't
06/05/2019, 00:59 - Jenit Jain: Sure
06/05/2019, 00:59 - Jenit Jain: Liar
06/05/2019, 00:59 - Dikshita Kothari: Plural never any single person
06/05/2019, 00:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I enjoyed compliments I don't understand why I'm supposed to apologise for this
06/05/2019, 01:00 - Jenit Jain: I haven't asked you to apologise for anything
06/05/2019, 01:00 - Jenit Jain: I'm just saying I'm glad you enjoyed, now suffer the down side
06/05/2019, 01:02 - Dikshita Kothari: You are no one to tell me what I will and what I will not suffer. If I did anything wrong I'll know it in the future. You don't have to take it upon yourself to tell me to suffer. What kind of a person are you? Why do you want to suffer? You don't like seeing me happy is it.
06/05/2019, 01:02 - Jenit Jain: I'm not making you suffer
06/05/2019, 01:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes you are
06/05/2019, 01:03 - Jenit Jain: Your actions have led to all this BS. Pranjal himself said that you didn't say no to him. What other proof you need. It's not my fault your crushes went out if the way which then included your bf
06/05/2019, 01:03 - Dikshita Kothari: I said no
06/05/2019, 01:03 - Dikshita Kothari: I used to roam around with you the entire time
06/05/2019, 01:03 - Jenit Jain: Great, next time try louder
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: He's not blind
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Jenit Jain: Yet he didn't stop
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: He stopped
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: What did he do ?
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Nothing !!!
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Jenit Jain: He didn't jeez
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: He did
06/05/2019, 01:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Are you dumb
06/05/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: Omg can you just stick to the facts your stupid girl
06/05/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: He confessed to me
06/05/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: Fuck it
06/05/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: You're not even making sense
06/05/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: Do what you want
06/05/2019, 01:05 - Jenit Jain: And you'll accordingly find a place to stay
06/05/2019, 01:05 - Dikshita Kothari: Because you would've beaten him up if he didn't
06/05/2019, 01:06 - Jenit Jain: Or maybe he was too scared to lie because he is and even looks like a pussy
06/05/2019, 01:07 - Dikshita Kothari: Who are you calling a pussy Jen you were the one who took kaustubh along with you to beat him up
06/05/2019, 01:07 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't even have the balls to go alone
06/05/2019, 01:07 - Jenit Jain: Hahahahahaha you think I can't beat him up alone. Kaustubh was there to stop be and not to beat him up
06/05/2019, 01:07 - Dikshita Kothari: If he would've come alone matlab toh def he would've gone back in two pieces
06/05/2019, 01:07 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't give me that bs
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: What you did was wrong
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't approve of it
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't forget it
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: And all this talk is supposed to make me more comfortable about your reconciliation with him
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: Lol doubt it
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: And I can't believe you would do that to someone who has helped your gf so much
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: You think rishab and jayant could have stopped me
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: Hahahha
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: Cute
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so grateful to him
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: Idgaf
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: Exactly
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Jenit Jain: Wow
06/05/2019, 01:08 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't give a fuck and I do
06/05/2019, 01:09 - Dikshita Kothari: We're at an impasse
06/05/2019, 01:09 - Jenit Jain: .

We're always fighting
06/05/2019, 08:34 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't understand you

06/05/2019, 08:34 - Jenit Jain: I just think what you want to do isn't worth what you'll be giving up
06/05/2019, 08:34 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so tired I'm glad this 3 month break is coming
06/05/2019, 08:34 - Jenit Jain: Great
06/05/2019, 08:35 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't have to give up anything
06/05/2019, 08:35 - Dikshita Kothari: But you're not understanding

06/05/2019, 08:36 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't forget it
06/05/2019, 08:36 - Jenit Jain: Well if I had a girlfriend who actually listened to me when things were fine then it wouldn't have messed up. Your mother was right. Your fault you didn't tell pranjal sternlyn
06/05/2019, 08:36 - Dikshita Kothari: And it's all because you're too stubborn to look past anything
06/05/2019, 08:36 - Jenit Jain: You don't like to confront and all no
06/05/2019, 08:36 - Jenit Jain: Costing you a relationship and numerous friendships
06/05/2019, 08:36 - Jenit Jain: You could have saved your friendship as well
06/05/2019, 08:37 - Jenit Jain: At least I don't fail to act
06/05/2019, 08:37 - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe you should get one then because honestly I'm exhausted. I just can't keep you happy. I definitely am not happy
06/05/2019, 08:37 - Dikshita Kothari: I failed to act so you think that you have the right to punish me
06/05/2019, 08:37 - Jenit Jain: Fine so are you breaking up?
06/05/2019, 08:37 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't be delusional
06/05/2019, 08:37 - Jenit Jain: I'm not punishing you
06/05/2019, 08:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes you are
06/05/2019, 08:38 - Jenit Jain: I just got rid of the problem my way
06/05/2019, 08:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Your way sucks and I know it's going to happen again and again and I can't deal with it
06/05/2019, 08:38 - Jenit Jain: I've already told you next time you handle it.
06/05/2019, 08:38 - Jenit Jain: I've to keep repeating myself
06/05/2019, 08:38 - Jenit Jain: You're stupid or whag
06/05/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: Now you don't even listen to what I say
06/05/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: I've told you the same thing again and again
06/05/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: You handle it and there won't be anything for me to handle
06/05/2019, 08:39 - Dikshita Kothari: This time also I'm going to handle it from here cause it's none of your business
06/05/2019, 08:40 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to interfere in my friendships again or even now
06/05/2019, 08:40 - Dikshita Kothari: If I want to fix it I will you shouldn't even want to stop me
06/05/2019, 08:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Jen please concentrate on your paper
06/05/2019, 08:40 - Dikshita Kothari: The hotstar password changed
06/05/2019, 08:41 - Jenit Jain: If they mess with your bf, bf will interfere. If you don't want me to interfere and still do everything according to your way ( which is practically not doing anything about the problem ) then break up now and spare both of us the time.
06/05/2019, 08:41 - Dikshita Kothari: If you think I'm the one who's going to call it off you're crazy
06/05/2019, 08:41 - Dikshita Kothari: I know better than to let you go
06/05/2019, 08:42 - Jenit Jain: So basically you'll do whatever the fuck you want and then you expect me to be like no this isnt too much?
06/05/2019, 08:42 - Dikshita Kothari: But then I also know better than to keep defying myself
06/05/2019, 08:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes

17/05/2019, 13:00 - Dikshita Kothari: And you don't believe in anything
17/05/2019, 13:00 - Dikshita Kothari: So if you don't then just talk abt the stuff you know

17/05/2019, 13:06 - Jenit Jain: I was just saying that if you think that India is a Hindu nation, then check the Preamble, which is the foundation of our nation. India's secularism is known world wide

20/05/2019, 15:22 - Dikshita Kothari: You tell now
20/05/2019, 16:29 - Jenit Jain: This is fine ish
20/05/2019, 16:29 - Jenit Jain: Other 2 are good
20/05/2019, 16:45 - Dikshita Kothari: What abt this ?
20/05/2019, 16:48 - Jenit Jain: It's nice but not fancy
20/05/2019, 16:48 - Jenit Jain: Video call when free bby
20/05/2019, 17:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Ok
20/05/2019, 18:21 - Jenit Jain: Accha okay you're busy
20/05/2019, 18:21 - Jenit Jain: So updating
20/05/2019, 18:22 - Jenit Jain: I got internship, through ankurs contacts, with ankur.
20/05/2019, 18:24 - Jenit Jain: The internship that j really wanted, I'm not pursuing that.
Because 
a) I will really have to dedicate time to it so I won't be able to practice for the placements which is priority.
b) too fucking far so wasting too much time during such a critical vacation.
c) the internship I'm doing is basically a scam. Like they are a proper corporate company but since it's through reference, they don't really expect us to do much, I don't have to go there, and their problem statement for us is very similar to my previous internship so I'll easily do it. Plus I'll have time for small projects and placement prep
20/05/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: I don't think I'll regret this decision
20/05/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: And finally I can get vacation routine since I know what's happening.
20/05/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: I want you to support my decision
20/05/2019, 18:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
20/05/2019, 18:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Do
20/05/2019, 18:35 - Dikshita Kothari: What's the problem
20/05/2019, 18:35 - Dikshita Kothari: What's placement prep ?
20/05/2019, 18:37 - Jenit Jain: Competitive coding data structures and interview questions
20/05/2019, 18:39 - Dikshita Kothari: Acha
20/05/2019, 18:39 - Dikshita Kothari: And you have to allocate separate time for this ?
20/05/2019, 18:39 - Jenit Jain: Yes everyday thing. This is main. Then internship. Then the chotu projects
20/05/2019, 18:40 - Jenit Jain: According to me
20/05/2019, 18:40 - Jenit Jain: Because if I don't get a good job, then whatever I've done till date from school doesn't really count
20/05/2019, 19:22 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay Jen
20/05/2019, 19:23 - Dikshita Kothari: If you're confident it's the right decision then go for it !

21/05/2019, 17:13 - Jenit Jain: You need to tell your mom that it's your vacation too
21/05/2019, 17:13 - Dikshita Kothari: Idk what moms problem is
21/05/2019, 17:13 - Jenit Jain: 😂
21/05/2019, 17:13 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya that's why she gives me my own room and all
21/05/2019, 17:13 - Dikshita Kothari: Like she eats and doesn't wash her hand

21/05/2019, 17:16 - Dikshita Kothari: What other time do I have to spend with them
21/05/2019, 17:18 - Jenit Jain: You do realize that's it's just our age. We have a million things to worry about since we are going to be introduced to the proper world very soon. And parents can barely solve very few. Rest we are on our own. So it's fine dikshita.
21/05/2019, 17:18 - Dikshita Kothari: Dude my parents can solve everything
21/05/2019, 17:19 - Dikshita Kothari: No thanks I don't wanna be on my own
21/05/2019, 17:19 - Jenit Jain: You need to explain your mother all this instead of just blindly listening to them because when we were kids, they knew what should we do. But now that we're big, they can't really relate because their 20s were wayyyyy diff
21/05/2019, 17:19 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm fine with them making my decisions

21/05/2019, 17:20 - Jenit Jain: My parents definitely don't understand my position because no one has done engg in my family. I have no support what so ever. So my parents trust me enough to grow by myself while supporting just my basic needs.

14/06/2019, 23:07 - Jenit Jain: So i said you're beautiful inside, as a person. Don't let others decide the kind of person you are

14/06/2019, 23:11 - Jenit Jain: and she isnt anywhere properly
14/06/2019, 23:11 - Dikshita Kothari: If you say I haven't grown up once more I swear I'll get damn angry
14/06/2019, 23:11 - Jenit Jain: so attention seeking
14/06/2019, 23:11 - Dikshita Kothari: This is why I'm more mature than you are

14/06/2019, 23:15 - Dikshita Kothari: You should've thought about that before you had fun full last 3 years with her

14/06/2019, 23:17 - Dikshita Kothari: Arav*
14/06/2019, 23:17 - Dikshita Kothari: Who has been there for a year
14/06/2019, 23:17 - Dikshita Kothari: And has a questionable reputation himself
14/06/2019, 23:18 - Dikshita Kothari: Last sem you told me you trust Priyanka
14/06/2019, 23:19 - Dikshita Kothari: Now you're telling me you're kicking her out
14/06/2019, 23:19 - Jenit Jain: you really dont take all this stuff seriously no. you just want friends no matter the quality. bade hogaye ho. if you cant stand up for whats right no matter the consequences and the hard decisions you have to make then manipal mai 4 saal what did you even learn. Dikshita friendship mai loyalty and trust is the most important, if shes willing to sell her trust by lying about someone to gain some attention doesnt mean that she continues to deserve my or someone elses friendship. no matter how much ever fun youve had
14/06/2019, 23:19 - Dikshita Kothari: Wtf
14/06/2019, 23:19 - Jenit Jain: so please dont say that 3 years you had fun then you kick them out. i did the same thing with nethraa eventhough she hadnt done shit to me directly.
14/06/2019, 23:19 - Dikshita Kothari: Did you talk to her even once
14/06/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: To Priyanka
14/06/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: At that time i stood up for you and gave up that friendship. you dont see me cribbing over thoe decisions
14/06/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya and I regret not stopping your ass everyday
14/06/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: Stood up for me?
14/06/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: evidently i was wrong and im agreeing
14/06/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you specifically don't tell her anything
14/06/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: That's not how you treat people
14/06/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Damn Jen
14/06/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Imagine this happening to you
14/06/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: How would you cope
14/06/2019, 23:21 - Dikshita Kothari: With no chance to explain yourself
14/06/2019, 23:21 - Jenit Jain: i mean if you dont have the balls to defend yourself and keep some self respect then someone has to. so i did
14/06/2019, 23:22 - Jenit Jain: chance to explain what man. she'll shy away from embarrassment and then get awwkward. i know all this will only happen
14/06/2019, 23:22 - Dikshita Kothari: That wasn't your job you really need to learn to not interfere in other people's matters
14/06/2019, 23:22 - Dikshita Kothari: Antaryaami ho tum
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Baat nahi kiya usse uske pehle how can you assume
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Jenit Jain: I will definitely remember to not stand up for you, no matter the concequences, if you dont stand up for yourseld
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya please don't
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Jenit Jain: im not assuming anything.
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: No one asked you
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Talk to her directly
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Why can't you talk to a friend man
14/06/2019, 23:23 - Dikshita Kothari: She meant nothing for you that means
14/06/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: You were just looking for an excuse
14/06/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: Even with Nethraa some lame excuse you found with that apratim scenario
14/06/2019, 23:24 - Dikshita Kothari: Just TALK TO HER DIRECTLY
14/06/2019, 23:24 - Jenit Jain: because when arav fucks up he confesses immediately. he had allegations with another girl whom vidit dated last sem. when vidit got to the bottom of it, the girl couldnt say shit against arav because he was innocent. Other times he fucked up, he will say it and ask for further advice on how to unfuck it so i atleast can believe that
14/06/2019, 23:25 - Jenit Jain: Im sorry that i stopped talking to a GOOD friend because she was making your life a living hell.
14/06/2019, 23:25 - Dikshita Kothari: Arre so he's making the same mistake 600 times doesn't make it a mistake anymore that's a habit now
14/06/2019, 23:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Finally you got it right
14/06/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: you just wont understand some decisions because your levelof maturity doesnt allow you to comprehend such complex scenarios. im sorry the world isnt as simple as you want it to be
14/06/2019, 23:27 - Jenit Jain: his mistake is being alleged for shit he didnt do?
14/06/2019, 23:27 - Dikshita Kothari: How about I talk to you once my level of maturity matches yours at least that way we won't keep fighting about everything
14/06/2019, 23:28 - Jenit Jain: this is a discussion that goes on in all relationships. atleast we arent fighting about something between us so thats good
14/06/2019, 23:28 - Jenit Jain: discussions are how you learn new things
14/06/2019, 23:28 - Dikshita Kothari: You're saying this after calling me immature
14/06/2019, 23:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not like you Jen
14/06/2019, 23:28 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't see things the way you do
14/06/2019, 23:28 - Dikshita Kothari: And I don't like the way you see things
14/06/2019, 23:29 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't believe you're able to let go of an old friendship because of something stupid she said/did
14/06/2019, 23:29 - Dikshita Kothari: Atleast 50 times
14/06/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: hoping you learn something
14/06/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like your bullshit ideals
14/06/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not the one who needs to learn here Jen
14/06/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: well i'll be next you when the your fantasy world bubble breaks so its fine
14/06/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: I know what I know is right
14/06/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: time and again
14/06/2019, 23:30 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not going to change my thought process
14/06/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: .
14/06/2019, 23:31 - Dikshita Kothari: Are you waiting with a pin to pop it
14/06/2019, 23:31 - Dikshita Kothari: I know how the world works
14/06/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: i cant pop it. only life will pop it
14/06/2019, 23:31 - Dikshita Kothari: I know what happens
14/06/2019, 23:31 - Dikshita Kothari: The bubble popped longggggggggg back

14/06/2019, 23:32 - Jenit Jain: lol okay
14/06/2019, 23:32 - Dikshita Kothari: And this is what it is
14/06/2019, 23:32 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't believe me cause you didn't meet me in 10th
14/06/2019, 23:32 - Dikshita Kothari: And then in 11th
14/06/2019, 23:40 - Jenit Jain: aww when a boy you liked, liked someone else and not you?
14/06/2019, 23:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Are you sure you wanna put it like that ?
14/06/2019, 23:43 - Jenit Jain: dikshita even i had girl troubles that put me in depression and made me go to a shrink and what not
14/06/2019, 23:43 - Jenit Jain: and i still dont think thats when my bubble popped
14/06/2019, 23:43 - Jenit Jain: so yes i dont think that is when you bubble popped
14/06/2019, 23:43 - Jenit Jain: i dont think it still has so well
14/06/2019, 23:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Then it never will Jen
14/06/2019, 23:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Are you expecting me to change or something
14/06/2019, 23:45 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't understand
14/06/2019, 23:45 - Jenit Jain: and even if it does i'll be on your side. how bad can it be then right
14/06/2019, 23:46 - Jenit Jain: no i want you to realise how fucked up life can be and how your rules dont make sense in real life. and the sooner it happens the better else ^
14/06/2019, 23:51 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not going to grow up 
I'm not going to mature more 
No bubble exists to be popped
The stuff I've heard will send shivers down your spine 
No I will not share them with you 
Everyone deserves to be happy including me 
I will not be the reason for anyone's sadness 
Get this in your head Jen
I am not changing 
And stop trying to make me change 
I like being happy 
And I like being who I am 
It makes me proud of myself to think that I'm not one of the depressed souls in the world and I am the reason for anyone's happiness 
I know how fucked up life can be 
My rules are what I will stick by till the end 
Get in with it or just keep your mouth shut 
Because everything you say goes right against everything I would say 
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN 
STOP TRYING TO CHANGE ME
JUST. STOP. IT. 
I am very mature 
And I know what is right and what is wrong 
I will stick by that
14/06/2019, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: well im just stating my opinion
14/06/2019, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: and stop saying "stop trying to change me" bs.

15/06/2019, 16:31 - Jenit Jain: If me talking about people you don't know pisses you off then lesson learned
15/06/2019, 16:31 - Dikshita Kothari: You've been calling me immature
15/06/2019, 16:31 - Dikshita Kothari: For an entire sem now

15/06/2019, 16:32 - Jenit Jain: I'm just pointing out what I notice. If you disagree then that's that. Neither of us has to do anything about it
15/06/2019, 16:32 - Jenit Jain: Okay
15/06/2019, 16:33 - Dikshita Kothari: No you can't just say stuff like that all the time
15/06/2019, 16:33 - Dikshita Kothari: And expect me to just not do anything about it
15/06/2019, 16:34 - Jenit Jain: Atleast I give you an elaborate reason Everytime I call your actions immature. On the other hand you just insult and be rude and never give any justifications so well
15/06/2019, 16:34 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need this drama dude
15/06/2019, 16:34 - Dikshita Kothari: If you can accept that I'm immature then good for you
15/06/2019, 16:34 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like your attitude
15/06/2019, 16:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Or the way you think
15/06/2019, 16:35 - Jenit Jain: See again no justification to prove this
15/06/2019, 16:35 - Jenit Jain: Or this
15/06/2019, 16:35 - Jenit Jain: Like I don't even know what you're talking about
15/06/2019, 16:36 - Jenit Jain: I have accepted already
15/06/2019, 16:36 - Dikshita Kothari: I just don't like it
15/06/2019, 16:37 - Jenit Jain: Regarding what

15/06/2019, 16:37 - Dikshita Kothari: What's the point I'm the one who has to accept it
15/06/2019, 16:37 - Dikshita Kothari: You're not going to change right
15/06/2019, 16:37 - Dikshita Kothari: Can't even ask you to
15/06/2019, 16:39 - Jenit Jain: See I'm not like you
15/06/2019, 16:39 - Jenit Jain: If I see an opportunity for you to learn I'll point it out, learning not learning is your call
15/06/2019, 16:40 - Jenit Jain: If you show me that I was actually wrong about something. Like my thoughts or actions were very wrong then obviously I'll try to improve on thay
15/06/2019, 16:40 - Dikshita Kothari: No you will not cause you don't know the right thing yourself
15/06/2019, 16:40 - Dikshita Kothari: You think I'm wrong
15/06/2019, 16:40 - Dikshita Kothari: I think you're wrong
15/06/2019, 16:40 - Jenit Jain: Although this takes effort which clearly you don't care to take so no point talking about it
15/06/2019, 16:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Read last night's chat
15/06/2019, 16:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Again and again I can't say the same things
15/06/2019, 16:41 - Jenit Jain: When did I say that I'm going to ghost Priyanka or ignore her or do anything to ruin the friendship Ive had with her you tell me
15/06/2019, 16:44 - Dikshita Kothari: The fact that you're willingly just throwing her aside is just bad
15/06/2019, 16:44 - Jenit Jain: Where did I say this
15/06/2019, 16:44 - Jenit Jain: You just assumed
15/06/2019, 16:44 - Dikshita Kothari: No
15/06/2019, 16:45 - Dikshita Kothari: You're choosing Arav over her is also wrong
15/06/2019, 16:45 - Jenit Jain: I was giving you information about what happened and you just jumped to a conclusion
15/06/2019, 16:45 - Jenit Jain: That's my decision
15/06/2019, 16:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya it's wrong
15/06/2019, 16:45 - Jenit Jain: Okay
15/06/2019, 16:48 - Jenit Jain: And who are you to jump to this conclusion without knowing either of them even adequately well
15/06/2019, 16:48 - Dikshita Kothari: You've known her longer
15/06/2019, 16:48 - Jenit Jain: Babu how does it matter
15/06/2019, 16:48 - Dikshita Kothari: And she's also your friend
15/06/2019, 16:49 - Jenit Jain: I've known my school friends the longest but it's not like they are my closestttt friends no.
15/06/2019, 16:49 - Dikshita Kothari: No I didn't like it

15/06/2019, 16:49 - Jenit Jain: But you know the lengths I will go for them
15/06/2019, 16:49 - Dikshita Kothari: You should've been at least wanting to listen to her side
15/06/2019, 16:49 - Jenit Jain: It's not like that
15/06/2019, 16:49 - Dikshita Kothari: You were legit badmouthing her to me
15/06/2019, 16:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Is this what you do about me to other people
15/06/2019, 16:50 - Jenit Jain: Idm listening it's just that I know what it will be. She'll start retracting step by sgep
15/06/2019, 16:50 - Dikshita Kothari: You always tell everyone everything na
15/06/2019, 16:50 - Jenit Jain: You please stop this.

15/06/2019, 16:50 - Dikshita Kothari: It's not supposed to be shared
15/06/2019, 16:51 - Jenit Jain: Like I don't even know how to handle you RN because you're just assuming stuff and getting pissed because of it.
15/06/2019, 16:51 - Dikshita Kothari: You were not supposed to share something she did wrong with me
15/06/2019, 16:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Protect her not demean her
15/06/2019, 16:51 - Dikshita Kothari: This is not how you're supposed to do
15/06/2019, 16:51 - Jenit Jain: Why should I protect someone who defaming someone else for the laughs.
15/06/2019, 16:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause she's your friend
15/06/2019, 16:53 - Jenit Jain: I'm sorry jeez. I just wanted to tell because it was kinda funny how things took a turn and it was a drunken night so that adds a funny element. And Priyanka missed her flight because she was too drunk to wake up is even more hilarious. WHY CANT YOU SEE THE REASON I TOLD YOU THE THING. YOURE FIGHTING FOR A BS REASON.
15/06/2019, 16:53 - Jenit Jain: Yeah well since she did it to my other friend I'm not going to interfere. Which is what I'm doing
15/06/2019, 16:53 - Dikshita Kothari: IT'S NOT FUNNY WHEN YOU CALL ME IMMATURE YOU DUMBO
15/06/2019, 16:54 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm going to the gym
15/06/2019, 16:54 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't wanna talk about this anymore
15/06/2019, 16:54 - Jenit Jain: Honey, you can learn how to defend yourself. And argue back,which you did, so it's fine.
15/06/2019, 16:55 - Dikshita Kothari: If you talk bullshit I will call it
15/06/2019, 16:55 - Jenit Jain: On the other hand you don't remove time for me in ldr. It's pissing off for me too, so I decide hey I'll tell dikshita a funny story so we can talk. But no. In that story also you will remove something to fight.
15/06/2019, 16:55 - Jenit Jain: And then you send such conversation stopper messages
15/06/2019, 16:55 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like LDR I already told you
15/06/2019, 16:56 - Dikshita Kothari: It's not funny
15/06/2019, 16:56 - Jenit Jain: So you just stop giving a fuck about a relationship you've invested so much time in?
15/06/2019, 16:56 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't find it funny
15/06/2019, 16:56 - Jenit Jain: Yeah well Priyanka was laughing at her situation so fuck you. If she can find it funny then even others can.
15/06/2019, 16:56 - Dikshita Kothari: So now you get why you're wrong with Priyanka ?
15/06/2019, 16:57 - Jenit Jain: You're really unbelievable.
15/06/2019, 16:57 - Dikshita Kothari: No I'm right
15/06/2019, 16:58 - Jenit Jain: If I did some shit and then you stop giving a fuck about the relationship then the situation is similar. Moreover, it still won't be equal because my investment in the relationship has been WAY more than my investment in my friendships, especially Priyankad
15/06/2019, 16:59 - Jenit Jain: I have my priorities in place at least. More than what I can say for you.
15/06/2019, 17:04 - Jenit Jain: Reply
15/06/2019, 17:05 - Dikshita Kothari: This message was deleted
15/06/2019, 17:06 - Dikshita Kothari: It's similar
15/06/2019, 17:06 - Jenit Jain: Not even close
15/06/2019, 17:06 - Jenit Jain: Not even a bit
15/06/2019, 17:07 - Dikshita Kothari: That's not the point I was trying to explain why you're wrong
15/06/2019, 17:07 - Dikshita Kothari: So even if investment is less
15/06/2019, 17:07 - Dikshita Kothari: Doesn't mean it's completely different
15/06/2019, 17:07 - Jenit Jain: And I'm explaining why I'm not wrong
15/06/2019, 17:08 - Jenit Jain: What about this ha
15/06/2019, 17:08 - Jenit Jain: Reply to this
15/06/2019, 17:08 - Dikshita Kothari: My priorities ?
15/06/2019, 17:08 - Dikshita Kothari: What's wrong with that ?
15/06/2019, 17:09 - Jenit Jain: Ldr wouldn't have been a problem if I guess this relationship / I was more important than you know your normal friends.
15/06/2019, 17:09 - Jenit Jain: Since your investment is equal in both cases or probably less in mine.
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Dikshita Kothari: LDR has alwaysssss been a problem
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: 100 times you've tried no
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: Dont darecompare me to mahiman
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Dikshita Kothari: I just know it
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Jenit Jain: How many days did you know him for before starting ldr, 10?
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Dikshita Kothari: I know how I get in an ldt
15/06/2019, 17:10 - Dikshita Kothari: 5 years maybe more
15/06/2019, 17:11 - Jenit Jain: You don't have any explanation then for problem with ldr except misplaced priorities
15/06/2019, 17:11 - Jenit Jain: And met him for 10 days on a stretch
15/06/2019, 17:11 - Dikshita Kothari: What misplaced priority?
15/06/2019, 17:11 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not comparing
15/06/2019, 17:11 - Dikshita Kothari: I know why ldr is hard for me
15/06/2019, 17:11 - Dikshita Kothari: Bas
15/06/2019, 17:12 - Dikshita Kothari: You want me to prioritise you above who?
15/06/2019, 17:12 - Jenit Jain: That normal friendships and a 3 year relationship don't have a difference for you. And since they are different for me, thats the reason I can conclude that Priyanka was wrong fast enough
15/06/2019, 17:13 - Jenit Jain: Please share
15/06/2019, 17:13 - Jenit Jain: Idc who you put me above. I'm just saying that I'm clearly it above your friends hence you think that the Priyanka thing is wrong.
15/06/2019, 17:14 - Jenit Jain: Moreover you should be deciding that. All I can do is accept my poor fate.
15/06/2019, 17:25 - Jenit Jain: And you shut off your mobile data when you feel like it so you don't have to reply anymore. Running away from arguments is so typical of you.
15/06/2019, 17:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Kyunki it's not the same
15/06/2019, 17:37 - Jenit Jain: Thabks for failing the test of time.
15/06/2019, 17:39 - Jenit Jain: You're not replying only to the other messages
15/06/2019, 17:55 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm out with Mom
15/06/2019, 17:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't accept it
15/06/2019, 17:55 - Dikshita Kothari: You can leave whenever the fuck you want
15/06/2019, 17:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya that one's on me
15/06/2019, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: You tell me if you're up for dating man I don't want to be such a liability in your life
15/06/2019, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: Because that's sure how you're treating me rn
15/06/2019, 18:01 - Jenit Jain: You don't even think twice before talking.
15/06/2019, 19:49 - Dikshita Kothari: What Jen
15/06/2019, 19:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Anything I say pisses you off
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I'm not treating you well
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Jenit Jain: You know such thing pisses both of us off
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not in that headspace rn
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Jenit Jain: It's fine fuck it. I love you anyway
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Dikshita Kothari: No I actually mean it Jen
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Jenit Jain: What'd you mean
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I mean if I can't keep you happy
15/06/2019, 19:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I shouldn't hold you back
15/06/2019, 19:51 - Jenit Jain: Don't you want to work on the relationship instead of this
15/06/2019, 19:51 - Jenit Jain: What happened talk to me
15/06/2019, 19:52 - Jenit Jain: Is it because of the vidushi situation
15/06/2019, 19:53 - Dikshita Kothari: I've tried
15/06/2019, 19:53 - Dikshita Kothari: Firse last sem ka repeat nahi chahiye for you
15/06/2019, 19:53 - Dikshita Kothari: Again if I say something you'll find it bad
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes and more
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Jenit Jain: So what you have to
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Jenit Jain: Like what more
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Jenit Jain: You don't tell me only how will I help you or help relationship
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Dikshita Kothari: It's actually related to that
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Dikshita Kothari: So just assume it's that
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Jenit Jain: What's *that*
15/06/2019, 19:54 - Jenit Jain: Say*
15/06/2019, 19:57 - Jenit Jain: Tell me! I'm not understanding anything
15/06/2019, 20:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Vidushi ka scene only
15/06/2019, 20:02 - Dikshita Kothari: It's a damn unhappy scene at home
15/06/2019, 20:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Now she's gone for some weekend getaway
15/06/2019, 20:03 - Jenit Jain: With?
15/06/2019, 20:03 - Dikshita Kothari: So the situation is a little lighter
15/06/2019, 20:03 - Dikshita Kothari: My sister is my dadis favourite gdaughter
15/06/2019, 20:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Why idk
15/06/2019, 20:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Vivek and other people
15/06/2019, 20:03 - Dikshita Kothari: So my dadi no longer likes me
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Jenit Jain: Babu you don't share all these hardships that's why you feel so negative inside which I think is affecting everything in your life. Why don't you let me help you
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Dikshita Kothari: She doesn't even talk straight forward
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Dikshita Kothari: No
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't get it
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Jenit Jain: Aiyo how's it your fault.
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Dikshita Kothari: I have had enough drama for a lifetime this summer
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Dikshita Kothari: And last semester
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Jenit Jain: True
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Dikshita Kothari: Even if a single thing happens next semester
15/06/2019, 20:04 - Dikshita Kothari: I will not handle it correctly
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Dikshita Kothari: She slashed her hands with a razor you know
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Jenit Jain: I know honey
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Jenit Jain: I can't imagine what you're going through
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Dikshita Kothari: She has absolutely gone mad
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Dikshita Kothari: Multiple times
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Dikshita Kothari: 7 long marks she has
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Jenit Jain: But honestly, treating me like the opposition isn't making anything better. For us or for only you also
15/06/2019, 20:05 - Dikshita Kothari: It won't go

15/06/2019, 20:06 - Dikshita Kothari: If one sister is this crazy surely the other one is
15/06/2019, 20:06 - Dikshita Kothari: See what I mean ?
15/06/2019, 20:07 - Dikshita Kothari: The mom isn't able to give time that's what people will say
15/06/2019, 20:07 - Jenit Jain: You don't think like this. It doesn't even make sense biologically and you know it
15/06/2019, 20:07 - Jenit Jain: Log bolte rahege aur kaam Kya hai

21/06/2019, 21:51 - Jenit Jain: Hello sir this is Jenit here.
This is regarding the post made on smartminds facebook page.
Smartminds wants to take credit for my results yet the institute discredited my achievements and did not treat me the same way as the other toppers, all because I did not agree to sign an ambiguous document which would in turn be used to wrongly defame other institutions that have contributed equally to my education. 
I don't think what was done to me was right and now using my name for publicity isn't ethical hence I would like you to take the video down from the Facebook page and the YouTube channel immediately.
21/06/2019, 21:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Thanking You 
Jenit Jain

04/07/2019, 19:06 - Dikshita Kothari: We're on a break
04/07/2019, 19:06 - Dikshita Kothari: Till July
04/07/2019, 19:06 - Dikshita Kothari: When we meet
04/07/2019, 19:08 - Jenit Jain: is this because of what happened yesterday
04/07/2019, 19:09 - Jenit Jain: the do whatever you want. im still on your leash and plan to stay
04/07/2019, 19:14 - Jenit Jain: just do me a favour and go home and talk to me properly so that even i understand properly what you are going through because it is not fair to me that you bring up the past mistakes everytime. I need you to get over them and accept them and accept that i fucked up. I understand that you need a break and that you shall have. But for a healthier future, i need you to keep the past where it belongs because i cant afford a break every time we do long distance (which can happen a lot in case we get different colleges)/
04/07/2019, 19:19 - Jenit Jain: your mental health is very important to me and hence i shall do my best to do whatever to get your mind some peace. if except the break theres anyway i can help you then please let me know, because you know i'll forever be by your side

05/07/2019, 06:33 - Dikshita Kothari: Did you not find anything different in April ?

05/07/2019, 06:34 - Dikshita Kothari: We were /are not healthy
05/07/2019, 06:35 - Jenit Jain: I disagree with this
05/07/2019, 06:35 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like the fact that I need your approval to do things
05/07/2019, 06:36 - Dikshita Kothari: I've told you this before also right
05/07/2019, 06:36 - Jenit Jain: Yes
05/07/2019, 06:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Many times
05/07/2019, 06:36 - Dikshita Kothari: Right
05/07/2019, 06:36 - Jenit Jain: And many times I've told you that I want and update on what you're doing and don't want you to take my permission
05/07/2019, 06:37 - Dikshita Kothari: No that's not how it works with you right
05/07/2019, 06:37 - Dikshita Kothari: If I want to do something that you disapprove of
05/07/2019, 06:38 - Dikshita Kothari: You'll give me stuff like
05/07/2019, 06:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Main maar doonga and all that
05/07/2019, 06:38 - Dikshita Kothari: I can't accept that
05/07/2019, 06:38 - Jenit Jain: Extra but okay
05/07/2019, 06:38 - Dikshita Kothari: No this is exactly what you say
05/07/2019, 06:39 - Jenit Jain: If you say so
05/07/2019, 06:39 - Dikshita Kothari: So there are two things that I have done that you disapprove of
05/07/2019, 06:39 - Dikshita Kothari: I spoke to saurak and apologized
05/07/2019, 06:39 - Jenit Jain: I still disapprove of that
05/07/2019, 06:40 - Jenit Jain: And will never back away from that I'm sorry
05/07/2019, 06:40 - Jenit Jain: I could have handled it better while disapproving of it, so sorry I couldn't do better
05/07/2019, 06:41 - Dikshita Kothari: I apologized to pranjal immediately after you said it was okay but then you said no later and then when I asked you what you would do if I told you you said that maar doonga
05/07/2019, 06:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Both I did on the last exam day
05/07/2019, 06:42 - Jenit Jain: Haven't we discussed enough about this matter already?
05/07/2019, 06:42 - Dikshita Kothari: I couldn't share this with you
05/07/2019, 06:42 - Jenit Jain: What you couldn't?
05/07/2019, 06:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause I don't feel like I can share anything with you anymore
05/07/2019, 06:43 - Jenit Jain: You can honey. You always can. Not talking is what crumbles the relationship.
05/07/2019, 06:43 - Dikshita Kothari: I missed you a lot lesser than I had on any previous holidays
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Jenit Jain: I understand why you didn't tell me about kt. And I've moved passed it.
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Jenit Jain: But that doesn't mean I'll be okay with you not telling me things
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Dikshita Kothari: Because finally I got the chance to do what I want
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Jenit Jain: What are you implying
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Jenit Jain: Like what?
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Dikshita Kothari: Without running everything past you
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Dikshita Kothari: Whatever
05/07/2019, 06:44 - Jenit Jain: That doesn't answer the question
05/07/2019, 06:45 - Dikshita Kothari: If you were there you probably would've had a problem with vedant vatsal as well
05/07/2019, 06:45 - Jenit Jain: Since you didn't run anything past me and are feeling better about it then tell what you didn't run past me that is making you feel so good
05/07/2019, 06:45 - Jenit Jain: I've never had in the past also.
05/07/2019, 06:45 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you right
05/07/2019, 06:45 - Dikshita Kothari: Saurak and pranjal ka thing
05/07/2019, 06:46 - Jenit Jain: All this assumptions from your end is affecting the relationship and always has
05/07/2019, 06:46 - Jenit Jain: And?
05/07/2019, 06:46 - Dikshita Kothari: That's all
05/07/2019, 06:46 - Jenit Jain: I'm not understanding what you're implying
05/07/2019, 06:46 - Jenit Jain: .
05/07/2019, 06:47 - Dikshita Kothari: Hmm
05/07/2019, 06:48 - Dikshita Kothari: I liked my vacation because I didn't have to tell you what I was doing when every minute of everyday
05/07/2019, 06:49 - Jenit Jain: Why do you think I'm a bad person. Yes I've fucked up a lot. Yes I'm possessive of you. Yes I'm trying to change. I do everything to change myself for self improvement and so that I can be a better bf because you deserve that good. All I want is your happiness and I try to give you that. Yes my selfishness does hinder that sometimes and I accept my fault there. But you assuming the worst from me Everytime and taking precautions like not telling me stuff doesn't make the relationship any stronger than before. It in fact weakens it.
05/07/2019, 06:50 - Jenit Jain: Yeah I kinda disliked my vacation because I didn't know everything you did which makes me feel less integral part of your life. Which I probably am now
05/07/2019, 06:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Jen
05/07/2019, 06:51 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita you need to accept one thing, right now itself, you don't need my permission to do anything. All i want to know is what you're doing. After that you're a person yourself and can make your own decisions
05/07/2019, 06:51 - Jenit Jain: Is asking for an update that bad?
05/07/2019, 06:51 - Dikshita Kothari: You're awesome 
Thank you so much for doing so much for me
05/07/2019, 06:52 - Jenit Jain: Because clearly I haven't really gotten much this summer and clearly this summer you're having too much fun
05/07/2019, 06:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Maybe it's who I am
05/07/2019, 06:52 - Jenit Jain: Alright
05/07/2019, 06:53 - Jenit Jain: Reply
05/07/2019, 06:54 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like someone controlling me like you do
05/07/2019, 06:54 - Jenit Jain: I've stopped doing that man
05/07/2019, 06:54 - Jenit Jain: Why won't you believe it.
05/07/2019, 06:55 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't like someone continuously criticising my decisions
05/07/2019, 06:55 - Jenit Jain: Like what
05/07/2019, 06:55 - Jenit Jain: Name instances
05/07/2019, 06:55 - Dikshita Kothari: Making friends
05/07/2019, 06:55 - Dikshita Kothari: And even I don't like criticising yours
05/07/2019, 06:55 - Dikshita Kothari: You know what you have done Jen
05/07/2019, 06:56 - Jenit Jain: You make friends man. I want you to make friends. You don't give a fuck about socialising it's not my fault
05/07/2019, 06:57 - Jenit Jain: No I don't. I took pranjal from you. Fine. You can say that's my fault. Even though it was necessary and you didn't keep your word of handlong the situation. You have no idea how uncomfortable j was with our situation then. I kept telling your for months please handle it.
05/07/2019, 06:57 - Jenit Jain: And yet you couldnt care enough.
05/07/2019, 06:57 - Dikshita Kothari: You have very conveniently isolated me from all my guy friends and now the only friends I have who are guys are your friends. I was supposed to make more friends in college and become more extroverted. And I was doing such a good job with it.
05/07/2019, 06:57 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm uncomfortable with it now
05/07/2019, 06:58 - Jenit Jain: When it comes to your other friends, I'm sorry they left. I really am. But it's not my fault they didn't care enough for your friendship that they left as easily as they did.
05/07/2019, 06:58 - Dikshita Kothari: I love you as a person Jen 
I'm not sure how I feel about us being in a relationship 
It's like we have just stopped being in sync
05/07/2019, 06:58 - Jenit Jain: You were not doing a good job. How many million times have you resisted from being an extrovert.
05/07/2019, 06:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need that to be judged by you
05/07/2019, 06:59 - Jenit Jain: And all those guys friends left you for you. Not for me. And the ones who have left you because of me, I've already accepted tbat
05/07/2019, 06:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want to be judged by you anymore
05/07/2019, 06:59 - Dikshita Kothari: And that's it
05/07/2019, 06:59 - Jenit Jain: Is this how you break up?
05/07/2019, 06:59 - Jenit Jain: I'm not judging.
05/07/2019, 07:00 - Jenit Jain: As the person who has stuck by you everyday since you stepped into college, I'm giving my honest opinion
05/07/2019, 07:00 - Dikshita Kothari: I have stuck by you as well or do you think it's just a one way street
05/07/2019, 07:00 - Jenit Jain: You have definitely
05/07/2019, 07:01 - Jenit Jain: And your opinion is the most important thing to me
05/07/2019, 07:01 - Jenit Jain: I guess this is just a one way street
05/07/2019, 07:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes it is
05/07/2019, 07:01 - Jenit Jain: Elaborate the sync
05/07/2019, 07:01 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I'm not like that
05/07/2019, 07:01 - Jenit Jain: Wow
05/07/2019, 07:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Everything I say pisses you off
05/07/2019, 07:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Everything you say pisses me off
05/07/2019, 07:02 - Dikshita Kothari: I want to be able to support you
05/07/2019, 07:02 - Jenit Jain: You're talking about last se. Which was equally bad for both of us.
05/07/2019, 07:02 - Dikshita Kothari: I want to be able to make us a team
05/07/2019, 07:02 - Jenit Jain: Let's please try.
05/07/2019, 07:03 - Dikshita Kothari: I want to be a team player

05/07/2019, 07:03 - Jenit Jain: And i want to try my best to be one.
05/07/2019, 07:03 - Dikshita Kothari: But I cannot stay in a team who's ideologies I don't agree with
05/07/2019, 07:03 - Dikshita Kothari: We are very different from each other
05/07/2019, 07:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Everything is a conflict
05/07/2019, 07:03 - Jenit Jain: Are you breaking up?
05/07/2019, 07:05 - Dikshita Kothari: I am sorry
05/07/2019, 07:06 - Jenit Jain: And yet we want the best for each other. That's what matters

05/07/2019, 07:06 - Dikshita Kothari: I am sorry Jen
05/07/2019, 07:07 - Dikshita Kothari: You can ask me anything you want
05/07/2019, 07:07 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry I'm doing this on the phone
05/07/2019, 07:07 - Jenit Jain: So this isn't a break?
05/07/2019, 07:08 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't think we should be in a relationship anymore

05/07/2019, 07:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry
05/07/2019, 07:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Please

05/07/2019, 07:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I cannot do ldr
05/07/2019, 07:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Jenitt this is not healthy
05/07/2019, 07:49 - Jenit Jain: You won't have to
05/07/2019, 07:49 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want to make you cry
05/07/2019, 07:49 - Jenit Jain: What isnt
05/07/2019, 07:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay then I'm there
05/07/2019, 07:50 - Jenit Jain: Not your fault I'm a wuss
05/07/2019, 07:50 - Jenit Jain: We can easily sort out all our problems sitting down calmly
05/07/2019, 07:51 - Jenit Jain: Just say I'm not worth the effort of going through so much mehnet and emotion
05/07/2019, 07:51 - Jenit Jain: And I won't say anything after that
05/07/2019, 07:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Nooooo
05/07/2019, 07:51 - Dikshita Kothari: I cannot do ldr
05/07/2019, 07:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause I cannot handle the anxiety
05/07/2019, 07:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I hate it
05/07/2019, 07:52 - Jenit Jain: You keep saying this doesn't make it any clearer
05/07/2019, 07:52 - Dikshita Kothari: And you know it
05/07/2019, 07:52 - Jenit Jain: What anxiety
05/07/2019, 07:52 - Dikshita Kothari: Or stress
05/07/2019, 07:52 - Dikshita Kothari: I cannot handle it
05/07/2019, 07:52 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita you shifted from blaming me for saurak and pranjal and all to the ldr thing to we are very different thing.
05/07/2019, 07:53 - Jenit Jain: Are you just looking for reasons to break up? Because if you are then tell me I'll make it easier for you.
05/07/2019, 07:53 - Jenit Jain: But if you have a problem, then we can solve it together and you know we can solve anything
05/07/2019, 07:54 - Jenit Jain: There's no stress honey.
05/07/2019, 07:54 - Dikshita Kothari: Please Jen
05/07/2019, 07:54 - Dikshita Kothari: Please please please don't make it harder
05/07/2019, 07:54 - Jenit Jain: Why treat a relationship like a burden when it's not. Don't make it one.
05/07/2019, 07:54 - Jenit Jain: Say it then
05/07/2019, 07:54 - Dikshita Kothari: If it works out in the future it might
05/07/2019, 07:54 - Dikshita Kothari: Not now
05/07/2019, 07:55 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita you're treating a 2 month vacation as ldr
05/07/2019, 07:55 - Jenit Jain: Say the actual reason. You've been conflicting yourself a lot.
05/07/2019, 07:55 - Jenit Jain: How is that fair to ne
05/07/2019, 07:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Ldr will happen in the future
05/07/2019, 07:58 - Jenit Jain: Future saath Mai handle karege
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Jenit Jain: Am I not worth to go through any pain? Any sacrifice? What about our gtech
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Jenit Jain: Everything we've decided
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want gtech
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Jenit Jain: At least in the ball park
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Jenit Jain: Are you going to eth
05/07/2019, 07:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I will ruin everything if we're in an ldr

05/07/2019, 08:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Would you rather not talk to me at all than being a constant
05/07/2019, 08:02 - Dikshita Kothari: You're a real component
05/07/2019, 08:02 - Jenit Jain: Take a break till college and then we'll talk

05/07/2019, 08:04 - Jenit Jain: Is ldr and you not wanting to ask me for permission the only thing that made you do this
05/07/2019, 08:04 - Dikshita Kothari: No

05/07/2019, 08:05 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't feel the same way

05/07/2019, 08:09 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't feel what you feel for me
05/07/2019, 08:10 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't feel that way for you
05/07/2019, 08:10 - Jenit Jain: Use more words
05/07/2019, 08:10 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't love you like you love me
05/07/2019, 08:10 - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't for a long time
05/07/2019, 08:10 - Jenit Jain: Since the pranjal thing.
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Jenit Jain: ?
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Dikshita Kothari: I've been trying to tell you
05/07/2019, 08:12 - Dikshita Kothari: But I think I shouldn't keep you in the dark
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Jenit Jain: By not texting me much or communicatimg during the vacation
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Jenit Jain: About this?
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Dikshita Kothari: About how I feel
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you on the last exam day
05/07/2019, 08:13 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you
05/07/2019, 08:14 - Dikshita Kothari: But I couldn't do anything then
05/07/2019, 08:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Jennn
05/07/2019, 08:15 - Dikshita Kothari: You're my best friend
05/07/2019, 08:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Help me
05/07/2019, 08:15 - Dikshita Kothari: Help you and me
05/07/2019, 08:15 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita. If you think the pranjal thing was the initial deal breaker then I cant say anything. You were the girlfriend it was your job to keep the guys (the ones with such a humungous crush on you)away from us. And him saying those things on your birthday didn't improve anything
05/07/2019, 08:15 - Dikshita Kothari: No that's not your job
05/07/2019, 08:16 - Jenit Jain: It was yours
05/07/2019, 08:16 - Dikshita Kothari: It's notttttt
05/07/2019, 08:16 - Jenit Jain: It's not mine Ik
05/07/2019, 08:16 - Dikshita Kothari: You cannot decide who can and who can't talk to me
05/07/2019, 08:16 - Dikshita Kothari: Kuch galat nahi kiya usne
05/07/2019, 08:16 - Dikshita Kothari: A crush is a positive emotion
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Dikshita Kothari: You broke that boys spirit and then laughed about it
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Jenit Jain: You anyway decided to talk to someone which made me feel very uncomfortable for the most part of my relationship. I still accepted it as collateral for the relationship till I couldn't handle it.
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Jenit Jain: Till that time even you didnt handle it
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Dikshita Kothari: Don't make it look like my fault
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm done with this contract
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Jenit Jain: I gave you enough time.
05/07/2019, 08:17 - Dikshita Kothari: Conversation
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita your feelings weren't the only thing that were supposed to be taken care of in this relationship
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Jenit Jain: My feelings are equally legit
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Jenit Jain: And you didn't consider them for the longest time.
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Dikshita Kothari: And mine are not the same as yours
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Dikshita Kothari: And I cannot support your deekinhs
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Dikshita Kothari: Feelings
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Jenit Jain: And yes I know talking to them made you happy. But at the same time it crushed mine
05/07/2019, 08:18 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so sorry Jen
05/07/2019, 08:19 - Jenit Jain: Alright
05/07/2019, 08:19 - Dikshita Kothari: Exactly why I don't want to impose this relationship on you
05/07/2019, 08:19 - Dikshita Kothari: Nothing to be crushed about
05/07/2019, 08:19 - Jenit Jain: There's no imposition
05/07/2019, 08:19 - Jenit Jain: Alright
05/07/2019, 08:20 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm taking off
05/07/2019, 08:20 - Jenit Jain: Have a safe flight.
05/07/2019, 08:20 - Dikshita Kothari: Boradinh is complete
05/07/2019, 08:20 - Dikshita Kothari: You too have a safe flight
05/07/2019, 08:20 - Jenit Jain: Which?
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm so sorry
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm really sleepy
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Dikshita Kothari: I haven't slept for a long time
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Jenit Jain: Send snaps from Russia and have fun.
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Jenit Jain: Sleep now.
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Yes I will
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Dikshita Kothari: Gn
05/07/2019, 08:21 - Jenit Jain: I love you.
05/07/2019, 08:22 - Dikshita Kothari: I won't stop being there for you
05/07/2019, 08:22 - Dikshita Kothari: Love you too
05/07/2019, 08:22 - Jenit Jain: Okay
05/07/2019, 11:21 - Jenit Jain: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MBEPqKKKx7XeQX8DhWJR53hrHWNuNrZK/view?ts=5d1b79ea
05/07/2019, 13:06 - Jenit Jain: About the possessive part, you need to realise that you've been molested twice in Manipal. You've been molested twice while you were my girlfriend. It took a very heavy toll on me too (I'm sure not as big as it took on you) . This is why I was very skeptical of your friends which affected the relationship. Even with kt I felt uncomfortable till kaustubh vouched for him. Not like that turned out any better. You need to realise that all I've ever wanted is for you to be safe and sound. I was trying to protect you from the ugly world. I'm sorry I failed. 
Whenever you're in other cities, I never am exactly tensed for your safety since I know the type of boys you're with ( and I know they will protect you however sloshed they are and won't take advantage of your drunkness so there's nothing to worry about ). 
And about the pranjal thing. Dikshita we both need to realise that we both were at fault. I clearly couldn't have taken it any longer especially after the birthday text. And I am not strong like you to break up over the ultimatum that I gave you. And you let him cross the boundary on multiple occasions. Yes he was your friend and I had no right whatsoever to interfere but at that time you didn't control it and I had to do something for me, since I received no help from your side, otherwise I wouldn't be comfortable in the relationship. It was very selfish what I did but know that I thought it would just improve our relationship over time since I removed a imaginary part. It saddens me to know that I was wrong.
05/07/2019, 13:10 - Jenit Jain: I'm very saddened to hear this especially after everything we've been through. And that too because of the pranjal thing. That hurt me the most. Couldn't you select real over imaginary just this once?
05/07/2019, 13:11 - Jenit Jain: I've tried my best to be the man you want because honestly, thats the best version of a person anyone (and I) can hope to be. I'm sorry I failed.
05/07/2019, 17:11 - Dikshita Kothari: Hello I landed
05/07/2019, 17:11 - Dikshita Kothari: It's 15 degrees it seems
05/07/2019, 17:12 - Jenit Jain: Hi
05/07/2019, 17:43 - Dikshita Kothari: I just received your texts
05/07/2019, 17:43 - Dikshita Kothari: I shall read once I get everyone in
05/07/2019, 17:45 - Jenit Jain: Sure
05/07/2019, 18:23 - Dikshita Kothari: Niceeeeeee I'll have to see full once the wifi gets connected
05/07/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: whose data are you using now
05/07/2019, 18:25 - Dikshita Kothari: Mine
05/07/2019, 18:25 - Dikshita Kothari: International roaming
05/07/2019, 18:25 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm reading your message
05/07/2019, 18:25 - Jenit Jain: okok
05/07/2019, 18:33 - Dikshita Kothari: Twice first of all how the fuck 
Second of all 
No it didn't take a toll on me 
What took a toll on me was the way you reacted to it and the long term effect. You removed such good friends Jen jinke liye maine mann se kiya jo bhi kiya. I don't like removing people from my life unless they fuck up real bad Jen please. I told you so many times don't tell anyone about the molestation and don't bring it up again and again. Tum bolke nikal lete ho I have to relive it each time. But you didn't even understand that. You didn't understand that everytime I see s p it all comes back because they became the price I had to pay for your discomfort. I don't pay people as prices Jen I don't. I told you so many times. You were never able to understand cause your thought process is different and I respect that. But I do not agree with it and this is a major issue for me. This is one of the reasons why I feel we're not in sync.
05/07/2019, 18:34 - Dikshita Kothari: Pranjal ka issue is that 
I told you billion times
05/07/2019, 18:37 - Dikshita Kothari: I feel that you isolated me from people who were helping me. I needed them. Complex components cannot be ignored.
05/07/2019, 18:37 - Jenit Jain: That classmate kinda mishandled and you and anirudh.
Dikshita I don't understand how you can be against me when s p didn't do shit for you during such a critical time. That was the time they could have stood up for you and the failed miserably. How can you give me shit for such shits. Baby I know you don't like to pay the price with people which completely makes sense. But s p thing I can't retract and if you think that what I did with them was wrong (like taking them away from you) then I'm sorry but I don't regret it.
05/07/2019, 18:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Huh which classmate
05/07/2019, 18:38 - Jenit Jain: Fine I agree he was helping you.  Like I could see that you really liked him as a classmate I won't deny. But it went overboard for me and you didn't handle it.
05/07/2019, 18:38 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't care if they did something for me or not 
I didn't make friends with them cause I wanted something in return
05/07/2019, 18:38 - Dikshita Kothari: Out of sync #2
05/07/2019, 18:38 - Jenit Jain: Arre remember some class party thing
05/07/2019, 18:39 - Dikshita Kothari: Oh god acha I remember
05/07/2019, 18:39 - Dikshita Kothari: See I don't even remember all that
05/07/2019, 18:39 - Jenit Jain: This is messed up. If your friends don't stand up for you when you get molested then they aren't really worth shit. Now you're talking non sense. Only out of sync #1 is legit.
05/07/2019, 18:40 - Dikshita Kothari: No
05/07/2019, 18:40 - Jenit Jain: What can I even say
05/07/2019, 18:40 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita how can you expect your friends to back away like they did after getting molested
05/07/2019, 18:40 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't expect anything from anyone and I've learnt this long ago
05/07/2019, 18:40 - Dikshita Kothari: Nooooooo
05/07/2019, 18:41 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm making friends for a good time
05/07/2019, 18:41 - Jenit Jain: Forget about me, even the girls condemned that action. So you think only you're right acting all "don't expect this and that"?
05/07/2019, 18:41 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not making them so that I can check their moral background
05/07/2019, 18:41 - Jenit Jain: That's good.
05/07/2019, 18:41 - Dikshita Kothari: Yahi toh problem hai ki you and I don't agree in anything
05/07/2019, 18:42 - Jenit Jain: I don't really want to talk about s p thing because you're not making sense there. And I really can't help you with it if you think what I did with them was wrong.
05/07/2019, 18:42 - Dikshita Kothari: And now you don't wanna talk about it
05/07/2019, 18:42 - Jenit Jain: Baby we need to talk about things we don't agree on properly instead of just forgetting and moving pass it
05/07/2019, 18:42 - Dikshita Kothari: Time is 4:12 here
05/07/2019, 18:42 - Dikshita Kothari: .
05/07/2019, 18:43 - Jenit Jain: Because I don't see anything wrong in what I did.
Pranjal thing I still see some things that I should have done in a much calmer way hence i want to discuss about that.
05/07/2019, 18:43 - Jenit Jain: 2.5 hours back I checked
05/07/2019, 18:43 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya
05/07/2019, 18:44 - Dikshita Kothari: Ballet tonight at the Bolshoi
05/07/2019, 18:44 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't handle it right
05/07/2019, 18:44 - Jenit Jain: Fancy
05/07/2019, 18:44 - Jenit Jain: I agree.
05/07/2019, 18:44 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm not talking about anything that happened in the past
05/07/2019, 18:44 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm talking about what I feel right now
05/07/2019, 18:45 - Jenit Jain: Okay let's talk present.
I'm still sad that you didny handle pranjal for all the time I told you to. Which led me to fucking up.
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Dikshita Kothari: I handled it
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I did
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Dikshita Kothari: You didn't believe me
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't trust me
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Jenit Jain: From your side I never doubted and you know that
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Ya so bas
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Dikshita Kothari: That's it
05/07/2019, 18:46 - Dikshita Kothari: I handled it from my side and it was none of your business
05/07/2019, 18:47 - Jenit Jain: Okay
05/07/2019, 18:47 - Jenit Jain: How did you handle that long inappropriate message from your birthday that made me feel veryyyyy uncomfortable?
05/07/2019, 18:48 - Dikshita Kothari: It was all positive emotion
05/07/2019, 18:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Usne mujhe touch tak nahi kiya hai Jen

05/07/2019, 18:49 - Jenit Jain: How does that matter omg 🙄
05/07/2019, 18:49 - Jenit Jain: Fine this I won't say anything
05/07/2019, 18:49 - Dikshita Kothari: The negativity I had to go through was muchhhhhh bigger than your negativity
05/07/2019, 18:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Much more
05/07/2019, 18:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Muchhhhhh
05/07/2019, 18:49 - Dikshita Kothari: More
05/07/2019, 18:49 - Jenit Jain: You've gone through that negativity for few months now. I went with pranjal negativity for few sems
05/07/2019, 18:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Much much much much much much moreeeeeeeeeee
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Jenit Jain: So let's not compare
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Dikshita Kothari: No
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Just stop it
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Jenit Jain: Yeah fine your class people also stopped talking because of the Domino so fine.
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Dikshita Kothari: For sems it seems
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I was with you
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I'm with you
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Dikshita Kothari: I told you I won't go
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Dikshita Kothari: Wasn't that enough
05/07/2019, 18:50 - Jenit Jain: Won't go?
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Dikshita Kothari: No it wasn't
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Dikshita Kothari: You know why
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Cause you are too insecure
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Out of sync #3
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Jenit Jain: With pranjal I was never insecure
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Won't go away
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Dikshita Kothari: Then why did you do it
05/07/2019, 18:51 - Dikshita Kothari: You don't even accept that you're insecure
05/07/2019, 18:52 - Jenit Jain: And tbh I was very insecure since 11th and till like almost 3rd sem. But I have noticed the improvement in me so I kinda disagree.
05/07/2019, 18:52 - Jenit Jain: Baby I'll accept only the truth
05/07/2019, 18:52 - Jenit Jain: I am insecure still. But nowhere near as much as you thinking. Like 20% of you thinking
05/07/2019, 18:53 - Jenit Jain: I have told you already, because I didn't want that extra negativity for me (it wasn't negative for you which tbh kinda irritated me but I get that hes your friend so can't say)
05/07/2019, 18:53 - Dikshita Kothari: No your insecurity is the main issue for everything
05/07/2019, 18:53 - Jenit Jain: Nononono
05/07/2019, 18:53 - Jenit Jain: I disagree.
05/07/2019, 18:53 - Dikshita Kothari: You isolated me from a lot of people
05/07/2019, 18:53 - Jenit Jain: Fair enough.
05/07/2019, 18:54 - Dikshita Kothari: I need this semester to get them all back
05/07/2019, 18:54 - Dikshita Kothari: My decision is final
05/07/2019, 18:54 - Jenit Jain: I made my peace with it last sem
05/07/2019, 18:54 - Jenit Jain: Which
05/07/2019, 18:54 - Jenit Jain: And may I ask who are these people
05/07/2019, 18:55 - Dikshita Kothari: It was more positive for me than negative for you during that time. I used to look forward to class. Jen you ruined a lot of things
05/07/2019, 18:55 - Dikshita Kothari: .
05/07/2019, 18:55 - Jenit Jain: Fine

05/07/2019, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Have some self respect

05/07/2019, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Which
05/07/2019, 18:57 - Jenit Jain: Pretty low standards
05/07/2019, 18:57 - Dikshita Kothari: That I will reconcile
05/07/2019, 18:57 - Dikshita Kothari: With these people

05/07/2019, 18:58 - Jenit Jain: Insecure thing I don't agree with. So I think you should let it slide.
05/07/2019, 18:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Oh please
05/07/2019, 18:58 - Dikshita Kothari: Whoever knows you knows you're insecure
05/07/2019, 18:58 - Dikshita Kothari: All the girls think it
05/07/2019, 18:58 - Dikshita Kothari: All my cousins think it
05/07/2019, 18:59 - Dikshita Kothari: My mom thinks
05/07/2019, 18:59 - Jenit Jain: This i don't agree with so this is definitely out of sync. Since I believe friends are supposed to be your protection from the world.
05/07/2019, 18:59 - Jenit Jain: Well if your mom thinks the DEFINITELY
05/07/2019, 19:00 - Dikshita Kothari: No I don't need them for that
05/07/2019, 19:00 - Jenit Jain: Okay
05/07/2019, 19:00 - Dikshita Kothari: Just STFU Jen

05/07/2019, 19:01 - Dikshita Kothari: I'm sorry
05/07/2019, 19:01 - Jenit Jain: And the first one also, our thought processes are different, I agree. But doesnt mean it has to be out of sync
05/07/2019, 19:01 - Jenit Jain: Dikshitaaaa
05/07/2019, 19:01 - Dikshita Kothari: It's out of sync
05/07/2019, 19:01 - Jenit Jain: Fine

05/07/2019, 19:01 - Dikshita Kothari: I can never let go
05/07/2019, 19:01 - Dikshita Kothari: We have to learn to walk before we run
05/07/2019, 19:02 - Dikshita Kothari: We have to learn to be friends
05/07/2019, 19:02 - Jenit Jain: Alright

08/07/2019, 10:46 - Jenit Jain: Oh 😂. Normally it's a gangster name in movies.
08/07/2019, 10:47 - Jenit Jain: You're getting the sauna no
08/07/2019, 10:47 - Jenit Jain: Too good it will be
08/07/2019, 10:47 - Jenit Jain: Mirchi ka kutta 😂
08/07/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Haha
08/07/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Yas
08/07/2019, 10:57 - Jenit Jain: Okay. I love you. Have a beautiful day.
08/07/2019, 11:46 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay thank you
08/07/2019, 12:37 - Jenit Jain: Jheal shouted at me when I told her our thing. Good lecture I got. So all girls are the same. And I'm the wrong one. I agree. Stuff I knew was right was clearly not. I see it now. Even with the s p thing. No matter what your reason is for wanting to talk to them and me being against it, I have no reason or right to stop you. Except just stating my opinion. I'm sorry for not keeping your individuality into account. You have been completely right all along and I've been a possessive prick all along. Even with the pranjal thing. I had no right whatsoever. No matter my uncomfortableness, all I could do (and did do) was express my discomfort. And I did. I shouldn't have done anything after that since you clearly just wanted him as a friend. I'm sorry that the domino effect costed you all your class friends.
08/07/2019, 12:40 - Jenit Jain: Ive been possessive I get it. I understand it. I'm ready to move pass that. 
I clearly want to state this.
I'm sorry that the past 3 years that I didn't give enough importancr to your individuality and adapt to it. I'm sorry I made you bend to my ways. I guess indirectly I took advantage of your good nature in this way, I'm sorry for that.
08/07/2019, 12:43 - Jenit Jain: I just want to comment on your out of sync things,
Somethings that you stated like me being insecure and all, that is definitely a problem that I promise to work on.
And other things that are out of sync, well they just make us who we are. They don't need to be in sync. My fault was getting you into my sync. What I want to do today onwards is respect the things that's are out of sync because your individuality is what's the most important to me and the thing I'm in love with and I would never want to change that or trade it with anything.
08/07/2019, 12:44 - Jenit Jain: Have fun first. You're on an awesome vacation. Please don't think about all this till you get back to the hotel.
08/07/2019, 12:49 - Jenit Jain: And I'm really sorry for not being able to come to Delhi.
08/07/2019, 13:00 - Dikshita Kothari: Jenittt what can I say aiyo 
You realised this toooooo late 🙈 
I told you so many times that things are changing for me I don't know why you turned a deaf ear. There is no point in telling me all this now. I'm really sorry for not being able to reciprocate.
08/07/2019, 13:01 - Jenit Jain: i never turned a deaf year. i just wasnt smart enough to understand what to do.
08/07/2019, 13:02 - Jenit Jain: please dont say theres no point. all i need is one chance.
08/07/2019, 13:02 - Jenit Jain: its never too late dikshita. i really am sorry and ready to give you what you want.
08/07/2019, 13:06 - Jenit Jain: i know you dont love me as much as i love you and who can blame you. but if there is some love left for me then i urge you to give this a chance. i know we wont be starting in the same places in the relationship. but i dont want to think what this could have been without atleast trying my level best.
08/07/2019, 13:07 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't want you to change yourself to fit my ideals

If you make things *more* difficult for me I will stop talking to you. In fact that's all you're doing. You know you said I'll be there for you but all you're doing is making my life tough. So since you have so many people to help you out I suggest you chill with them and leave me out of it. Stay away from my friends. And if you can't keep it simple stay away from me as well.

06/08/2019, 10:13 - Jenit Jain: Or do you want to chill in class after our talk?
06/08/2019, 10:14 - Dikshita Kothari: Outside my class ya ?
06/08/2019, 10:14 - Jenit Jain: Cool
06/08/2019, 14:59 - Jenit Jain: Waiting outside
06/08/2019, 15:06 - Jenit Jain: Incase you're confused then let me just be clear, cheated on me with mahiman
06/08/2019, 15:08 - Dikshita Kothari: Acha thanks for questioning my loyalty
06/08/2019, 15:08 - Dikshita Kothari: But okay
06/08/2019, 15:08 - Dikshita Kothari: Why do you think so
06/08/2019, 15:20 - Jenit Jain: How does it matter. Don't you have some other dick to attend to?
You know what you have done. Karma is right there behind you. 
I'll see you in hell.
06/08/2019, 15:26 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't need your bullshiy jenit
06/08/2019, 15:26 - Dikshita Kothari: Stop blaming me for something I haven't done
06/08/2019, 15:54 - Jenit Jain: Something you haven't done recently definitely doesn't include mahiman
06/08/2019, 16:08 - Dikshita Kothari: What is wrong with you ?! How dare you blame me like this
06/08/2019, 17:13 - Jenit Jain: see dikshita, we both know that if you weren't guilty (which you definitely are lol) you wouldn't be so scared inside. And rn you are scared that I know the truth so deny all you want.
06/08/2019, 17:14 - Jenit Jain: I was right to be possessive since you are such a person that you cheated on me. Since you know me well, you can imagine how good I must be feeling knowing that I was always right
06/08/2019, 17:37 - Jenit Jain: Honestly dikshita all I wanted to do today is to let you know that *I know* what you did. And officially cut all our connections because I can't even be friends with such low lives like you. (Funny thing how you wanted us to be friends). Anyway that's all from my end!
07/08/2019, 12:51 - Jenit Jain: What were you saying again? 😂
10/08/2019, 10:45 - Jenit Jain: So Divya forwarded me your message. I was going to send the following message to her but I'll just remove the middle man and send it here. So just assume I'm texting this to divya
10/08/2019, 10:45 - Jenit Jain: I would love to see her explain me what happened in delhi. Plus I never even held hands or any fucking thing with somiya ever let alone suck some dick. Plus he couldn't even keep his dick intact before "finishing too early" 😂. So  no it's not the fucking same at all. Moreover I don't have time to instigate people against her. I just need people to know that it wasn't entirely my fault and how much shit can hide behind her innocent face. Because everything just thinks that I'm the possessive shithead who caused the entire breakup. Knowing that my possessiveness was right all along (seeing that she did cheat on me with him), it gives me a sense of calmness that I was right all along. And yes she's right, I'm not a good judge of character, otherwise I wouldn't have wasted 3 years of my life behind a girl like her. And I didn't force you to accept any BS and you know it. She is too immature for me anyway seeing that she uses people just to satisfy her need for attention. And if she calls that her "new found peace" then God save her.
10/08/2019, 10:47 - Dikshita Kothari: Jen you can believe whatever you want
10/08/2019, 10:48 - Jenit Jain: I'd love to hear any explanation you have if you want to give one. I'm sure it'll be interesting
10/08/2019, 10:49 - Dikshita Kothari: You've already made up your mind that you're not going to listen
10/08/2019, 10:49 - Dikshita Kothari: Then there's no point
10/08/2019, 10:49 - Jenit Jain: I'm ready to listen if you wanna say
10/08/2019, 10:49 - Jenit Jain: No pressure
10/08/2019, 10:49 - Dikshita Kothari: As it is it's not like we're ever going to be friends
10/08/2019, 10:49 - Dikshita Kothari: So then for what should I clear it out
10/08/2019, 10:50 - Dikshita Kothari: It's just sad that for one text message you're questioning my loyalty to you for so many years
10/08/2019, 10:50 - Dikshita Kothari: It's not like I didn't meet mahi before when we were dating
10/08/2019, 10:51 - Dikshita Kothari: I was a good girlfriend and I know it
10/08/2019, 10:51 - Dikshita Kothari: You can believe whatever you want
10/08/2019, 10:52 - Dikshita Kothari: The reason I broke up with you was just you jenit
10/08/2019, 10:56 - Jenit Jain: Okay good talk.
10/08/2019, 10:56 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
10/08/2019, 10:57 - Jenit Jain: Did you cheat on me in the 3 years?
10/08/2019, 10:57 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't cheat at all
10/08/2019, 10:57 - Jenit Jain: Okay
10/08/2019, 10:57 - Dikshita Kothari: Emotionally yes
10/08/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: But that also only towards the end
10/08/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: For that I'm extremely guilty and extremely sorry
10/08/2019, 10:58 - Dikshita Kothari: I understand why it's coming off as I cheated physically
10/08/2019, 10:59 - Dikshita Kothari: But I didn't
10/08/2019, 10:59 - Jenit Jain: You did cheat physically ??
10/08/2019, 10:59 - Dikshita Kothari: I didn't cheat physically
10/08/2019, 10:59 - Jenit Jain: In Delhi?
10/08/2019, 11:00 - Dikshita Kothari: No
10/08/2019, 11:00 - Jenit Jain: I read the chats dikshita. I read everything
10/08/2019, 11:00 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay
10/08/2019, 11:00 - Dikshita Kothari: So the kiss being spoken about was not a lip to lip type
10/08/2019, 11:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Everything else was after the break
10/08/2019, 11:01 - Jenit Jain: What about the part where he finished too early??
10/08/2019, 11:01 - Dikshita Kothari: .
10/08/2019, 11:01 - Jenit Jain: Sure
10/08/2019, 11:01 - Jenit Jain: Well atleast I made you cum. More than I can say for your new endeavors😂
10/08/2019, 11:01 - Jenit Jain: You enjoy your shit
10/08/2019, 11:01 - Dikshita Kothari: Jenit
10/08/2019, 11:02 - Dikshita Kothari: If you want to listen you can
10/08/2019, 11:02 - Jenit Jain: You do you
10/08/2019, 11:02 - Dikshita Kothari: I don't know what that means
10/08/2019, 11:02 - Jenit Jain: It means goodbye.
10/08/2019, 11:02 - Dikshita Kothari: I have never done that with anyone but you
10/08/2019, 11:02 - Dikshita Kothari: Oh okay

10/08/2019, 11:03 - Dikshita Kothari: Goodbye
12/08/2019, 00:12 - Dikshita Kothari: <Media omitted>
12/08/2019, 00:27 - Jenit Jain: I never sucked someone's dick while being in a relationship unlike you.

12/08/2019, 00:48 - Jenit Jain: Jo karna hai karlo bhai
12/08/2019, 00:48 - Dikshita Kothari: Same to you
15/08/2019, 23:20 - Dikshita Kothari: What the fuck are you telling people? I did not cheat on you Jenit but now I really wish I'd left you the day you told me about somya. Why can't you just accept that it's not you i want to be with and move on? There's no need for this hideous revenge type scene. I broke up with you cause of your anger issues and not cause of anything else. What I do after the break up is none of your business.
16/08/2019, 01:37 - Dikshita Kothari: Meet me tomorrow if you can

Do that and I'll show you what vengeance is.
16/08/2019, 10:49 - Jenit Jain: Peace.
16/08/2019, 11:06 - Dikshita Kothari: Okay do what makes you happy 
Thank you for hearing me out
16/08/2019, 11:07 - Jenit Jain: Right back at you

03/09/2019, 19:08 - Jenit Jain: I'm not the blocking kind and muting won't make a difference if next she sends years from now.
03/09/2019, 19:08 - Jenit Jain: Dw she'll get over the breakup if she's not already and I cant ask her because I'm not rude.
