27/10/2019, 09:36 - Jenit Jain: cool.
27/10/2019, 09:37 - Sahil Garg: And you can make a master page with the UI
27/10/2019, 09:37 - Jenit Jain: and after the login, you have to sign up
27/10/2019, 09:37 - Jenit Jain: sign in

27/10/2019, 09:38 - Sahil Garg: Yes db and showing records, editing and all
27/10/2019, 09:38 - Jenit Jain: okay then you only handle
27/10/2019, 09:39 - Sahil Garg: For login,there needs to be separate login for admin I think
27/10/2019, 09:39 - Jenit Jain: and then the login option leads to which page?
27/10/2019, 09:39 - Sahil Garg: You can see the doc sent by maam

27/10/2019, 09:39 - Sahil Garg: And maybe search for bus textbox in top
27/10/2019, 09:39 - Jenit Jain: we can have the link the top corner or something and then that leads to another content page
27/10/2019, 09:40 - Jenit Jain: i think at the top should be calender tags
27/10/2019, 09:40 - Jenit Jain: the user can select dates
27/10/2019, 09:40 - Jenit Jain: and we have to query it like that
