Head of Department,

Date: 17th January.

Subject: Request for a leave for my son. 

Respected Ma'am,
      I am Rajesh Jain, father of Jenit Jain (160905070). I'm emailing to ask you to permit my son to come back to Mumbai for 10 days from 21st January to 1st February.
      Our daughter is getting married and we have family functions, starting from the 25th January. We realize that these are ill-timed and regret the inconvenience we cause. Please permit my son to repeat his assignments and labs that he misses during his absence.
       Thanking you in advance.

Yours Faithfully,
Rajesh Jain.

Please find the attached copy of the wedding invitation.
17/01/2019, 14:04 - Jenit Jain: And in the email attach the 28th and 29th pdf

17/01/2019, 19:32 - Jenit Jain: To,
Head of Department,
Computer Science and Engineering,
Manipal Institute of Technology.

Date: 17th January.

Subject: Request for a leave for my son. 

Respected Ma'am,
     I understand the inconvenience this causes but since the first function is on the 25th, he must be back by at least 22nd to get his attire for the upcoming functions.
      I assure you that Jenit understands that he'll be missing his studies and he is adamant about not slacking in his academics.
      I plead on the behalf of my family to allow Jenit to come back for his sister's wedding. We shall be very grateful for the same.
      Thanking you in advance. 
Yours Faithfully,
Rajesh Jain.
