27/07/2019, 13:48 - Aafreen Hirji: Did you talk to her what went wrong?
27/07/2019, 13:49 - Aafreen Hirji: Listen the trash is taking itself out
27/07/2019, 13:49 - Aafreen Hirji: Don’t ruin things
27/07/2019, 13:49 - Jenit Jain: She really just wanted to concentrate on her life and really believes that we are not right for each other
27/07/2019, 13:49 - Aafreen Hirji: Oh so she took that long to realize
27/07/2019, 13:49 - Aafreen Hirji: But that’s how people are
27/07/2019, 13:50 - Jenit Jain: Exactly
27/07/2019, 13:50 - Aafreen Hirji: They want something to just not feel that lonely and then when they think they can survive without it or they need some change they will just come up w the stupidest reason and leave
27/07/2019, 13:50 - Jenit Jain: None words are truer

27/07/2019, 13:51 - Aafreen Hirji: It taught you things
27/07/2019, 13:51 - Jenit Jain: Even I'm convinced that she is not coming back so I'll try to move on and see if we can be friends down the line
27/07/2019, 13:52 - Jenit Jain: Yes
27/07/2019, 13:52 - Aafreen Hirji: just take the good memories and look forward to better ones
27/07/2019, 13:52 - Jenit Jain: I guess
27/07/2019, 13:52 - Aafreen Hirji: Honestly being friends is not a good option
27/07/2019, 13:52 - Aafreen Hirji: Especially when you’re the one w feelings
27/07/2019, 13:52 - Jenit Jain: Thing is it can't be worse so might as well try lok
27/07/2019, 13:52 - Aafreen Hirji: Like even if you have little feelings for her

27/07/2019, 13:53 - Jenit Jain: She just hasn't gotten rid of the routine part
27/07/2019, 13:54 - Aafreen Hirji: Ohh so she did have this at the back of her head
27/07/2019, 13:54 - Aafreen Hirji: You gotta do it before she does
27/07/2019, 13:54 - Jenit Jain: It started when I threatened that guy
