01/02/2019, 13:00 - Apratim Mukherjee: Woh bhi chalega
01/02/2019, 13:01 - Apratim Mukherjee: ðŸ˜˜
15/02/2019, 13:09 - Jenit Jain: Informed search is the last thing
15/02/2019, 13:09 - Apratim Mukherjee: My textbook doesn't have
15/02/2019, 13:09 - Apratim Mukherjee: It's old
15/02/2019, 13:09 - Apratim Mukherjee: Lolz
15/02/2019, 13:11 - Apratim Mukherjee: I had the first edition
15/02/2019, 13:11 - Apratim Mukherjee: It's from third edition
30/03/2019, 17:31 - Jenit Jain: Apu
30/03/2019, 20:56 - Apratim Mukherjee: Ye wat up
31/03/2019, 02:20 - Jenit Jain: Is naive Bayes Classifier linear or non Linear
31/03/2019, 02:20 - Jenit Jain: And in it the number of training instances per class changes the output na
31/03/2019, 02:20 - Jenit Jain: What is this called?
31/03/2019, 02:20 - Jenit Jain: Local something na
31/03/2019, 02:20 - Jenit Jain: Like some technical word
31/03/2019, 02:20 - Jenit Jain: Is it called class likelihood
31/03/2019, 10:54 - Apratim Mukherjee: Log likelihood?
31/03/2019, 12:46 - Jenit Jain: Not used in Bayes theorem right
31/03/2019, 13:49 - Apratim Mukherjee: Bayes likelihood is different no
31/03/2019, 13:50 - Apratim Mukherjee: Prior, likelihood and estimator are the 3 things for Bayes right
31/03/2019, 14:00 - Jenit Jain: Arre but in Bayes there's a thing like right that if a particular class instances are more in the training set then that class is more likely to be predicted
31/03/2019, 14:02 - Apratim Mukherjee: That's because your prior is higher no
31/03/2019, 14:04 - Jenit Jain: Because the class likelihood is more?
31/03/2019, 14:36 - Jenit Jain: And this?
31/03/2019, 20:10 - Apratim Mukherjee: Non linear
31/03/2019, 20:23 - Jenit Jain: Because it doesn't have any specific weighted sum of the inputs that's why right
09/04/2019, 20:29 - Jenit Jain: What elective are you selecting
09/04/2019, 20:49 - Apratim Mukherjee: Cv
10/04/2019, 10:24 - Jenit Jain: Happy birthday Apu

10/05/2019, 23:12 - Apratim Mukherjee: Rip
10/05/2019, 23:13 - Apratim Mukherjee: Worcester Polytechnic Institute
10/05/2019, 23:14 - Jenit Jain: US meh hi rehja chutiya
10/05/2019, 23:14 - Jenit Jain: Research I wanna start
10/05/2019, 23:14 - Apratim Mukherjee: :c
10/05/2019, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: Tell me the process tomorrow or whenever you free. And this I'm literally counting on you and seeing the start of the year, you please don't let my year go as shitty as the start
10/05/2019, 23:16 - Jenit Jain: Love you thanks
10/05/2019, 23:16 - Apratim Mukherjee: Wat
10/05/2019, 23:16 - Apratim Mukherjee: What process
10/05/2019, 23:17 - Jenit Jain: How to go about doing the research part.
10/05/2019, 23:17 - Jenit Jain: Idk
10/05/2019, 23:17 - Jenit Jain: Help
10/05/2019, 23:17 - Apratim Mukherjee: What'd you wanna know
10/05/2019, 23:17 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
10/05/2019, 23:18 - Apratim Mukherjee: Research isn't a stand alone field man
10/05/2019, 23:18 - Apratim Mukherjee: The only way I encountered it was doing something to solve a specific problem
10/05/2019, 23:19 - Apratim Mukherjee: And on the way I figured out a slightly different method that people hadn't tried yet
10/05/2019, 23:19 - Apratim Mukherjee: Or seemed like it wouldn't work
10/05/2019, 23:19 - Apratim Mukherjee: Took me 1Â½ years to confirm it actually worked
10/05/2019, 23:19 - Apratim Mukherjee: :/
10/05/2019, 23:19 - Jenit Jain: Which was a tiny dataset, so your problem was how to get a larger training dataset and what  things can be done? Right?
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Apratim Mukherjee: Not really no
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: Did you publish it?
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Apratim Mukherjee: Not yet, need more data
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Apratim Mukherjee: Moved my stack to tpus
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: Nevermind then lol
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: Kiska bc
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Apratim Mukherjee: Trying to speed up the process
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Apratim Mukherjee: Google
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Apratim Mukherjee: Free credits
10/05/2019, 23:20 - Jenit Jain: You're going to continue with this at your internship?
10/05/2019, 23:21 - Jenit Jain: Accha ha I recently used their gpus. Too ez
10/05/2019, 23:21 - Apratim Mukherjee: I'll be using it in the internship
10/05/2019, 23:21 - Apratim Mukherjee: Will cite my own paper
10/05/2019, 23:21 - Apratim Mukherjee: Aw yis
10/05/2019, 23:21 - Jenit Jain: ðŸ˜‚
10/05/2019, 23:21 - Jenit Jain: Accha so over there you'll do something different?
10/05/2019, 23:22 - Apratim Mukherjee: A little different
10/05/2019, 23:22 - Apratim Mukherjee: But overall very similar
10/05/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: Ooo.
10/05/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: So finally
10/05/2019, 23:30 - Jenit Jain: I'm tired of Coursera. Prolly not going to do more than a course or 2. Already did 10
10/05/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: So what should I do ?
10/05/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: What I'm planning on for a couple of weeks is to perfect my older projects to tune them with whatever better I learned
10/05/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: But I want do something worthwhile. Especially that'll help me for my Master's application
10/05/2019, 23:31 - Jenit Jain: Any suggestions?
10/05/2019, 23:32 - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
29/05/2019, 13:51 - Jenit Jain: Boi. While selecting which model to pick in CV, should I select one with larger mAP or smaller Val loss?
29/05/2019, 18:00 - Apratim Mukherjee: Depends
29/05/2019, 18:01 - Apratim Mukherjee: If evaluation is same for both cases, then this situation shouldn't arise
29/05/2019, 18:01 - Apratim Mukherjee: It's not possible only if both were evaluated on the same thing
29/05/2019, 18:02 - Apratim Mukherjee: If they're evaluated on different sets then check how many images it was actually evaluated on
29/05/2019, 18:03 - Apratim Mukherjee: If there's slightly lower mAP for a significantly larger val set, choose that
29/05/2019, 18:13 - Jenit Jain: It was for the same set. I didn't know this fact.
29/05/2019, 18:13 - Jenit Jain: Basically trying to implement yolo.
29/05/2019, 18:14 - Apratim Mukherjee: I don't think it's possible
29/05/2019, 18:14 - Apratim Mukherjee: Smaller val loss should equal higher mAP
29/05/2019, 18:14 - Apratim Mukherjee: Unless there's a high class imbalance maybe
29/05/2019, 18:15 - Apratim Mukherjee: Nah actually even then it wouldn't be possible
29/05/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: Oh I realized what I messed up. I mistook Val loss for training loss nevermind
29/05/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: mAP is calculated for only the training set right?
29/05/2019, 18:17 - Jenit Jain: Or you can select?
29/05/2019, 18:22 - Apratim Mukherjee: mAP for val matters
29/05/2019, 18:22 - Apratim Mukherjee: That's all
29/05/2019, 18:23 - Apratim Mukherjee: You could calculate map for training but it has no significance really
29/05/2019, 18:24 - Apratim Mukherjee: You could check if your model is underfit or overfit though
29/05/2019, 18:24 - Apratim Mukherjee: High map for training, shit for eval means overfit af
29/05/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: Accha cool cool
29/05/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: Thanks
03/09/2019, 22:34 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
04/09/2019, 09:01 - Apratim Mukherjee: BET exam
04/09/2019, 09:01 - Apratim Mukherjee: Kill me
04/09/2019, 09:02 - Jenit Jain: Killing you before that exam would have really saved you a lotta trouble tru
04/09/2019, 09:05 - Apratim Mukherjee: I was sick also
04/09/2019, 09:05 - Apratim Mukherjee: Should have ended me
03/10/2019, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Why the fuck are you going home on the night of the photoshoot
03/10/2019, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Are you fucking retarded
03/10/2019, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Why you like this
03/10/2019, 20:54 - Apratim Mukherjee: Gotta go home boi
03/10/2019, 20:54 - Apratim Mukherjee: Can't do anything
03/10/2019, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: Go on 7th???
03/10/2019, 20:58 - Jenit Jain: Anyway your going to reach on 7th

03/10/2019, 23:13 - Jenit Jain: Akli baar Skype ki id dedio
03/10/2019, 23:15 - Apratim Mukherjee: De chuka
03/10/2019, 23:15 - Apratim Mukherjee: Usko _personal_ meeting chahiye
03/10/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: I hear that
03/10/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: It's alright
03/10/2019, 23:26 - Jenit Jain: I'll miss you
03/10/2019, 23:27 - Jenit Jain: It's irritating how you're missing everything
03/10/2019, 23:27 - Jenit Jain: Theek hai Kar Kar love you
05/10/2019, 00:42 - Apratim Mukherjee: Happy birthday dickhead
05/10/2019, 00:42 - Jenit Jain: Thanks cunt
14/10/2019, 15:15 - Jenit Jain: When deciding the length of sentence to take for an input you have to truncate it right because all the sentence in the dataset are different size. 
So 
1) how do you decide what length to truncate to, I tried to visualise the distribution of size and it's not a normal distribution.
2) how do you include the truncated part in the model
14/10/2019, 17:34 - Apratim Mukherjee: Pad
14/10/2019, 17:35 - Apratim Mukherjee: Usually people will find max length of a sequence and pad everything else
14/10/2019, 17:36 - Apratim Mukherjee: Or you can pass Nones too
14/10/2019, 17:37 - Apratim Mukherjee: Pad in batches but inter-batch can have variable lengths
14/10/2019, 17:45 - Jenit Jain: How?
14/10/2019, 17:50 - Apratim Mukherjee: You'll have to write your own batching function for this
14/10/2019, 17:50 - Apratim Mukherjee: Group similar lengths together
14/10/2019, 17:53 - Jenit Jain: This I understood but how will you input different length batches in the same model
14/10/2019, 17:55 - Apratim Mukherjee: Tf.keras lets you
14/10/2019, 17:55 - Apratim Mukherjee: You can pass None type for length in an lstm
14/10/2019, 17:55 - Apratim Mukherjee: I think
14/10/2019, 17:55 - Apratim Mukherjee: Just cross-check once
14/10/2019, 18:27 - Jenit Jain: Oh oh okay I'll checkk

04/11/2019, 05:00 - Jenit Jain: please to help thanks luv
04/11/2019, 17:20 - Apratim Mukherjee: Aise kaise bolu boss
04/11/2019, 17:22 - Apratim Mukherjee: This probably means you have a cycle in your graph
04/11/2019, 17:23 - Jenit Jain: Can I send you my model summary
04/11/2019, 17:23 - Jenit Jain: And code for archi
04/11/2019, 17:23 - Jenit Jain: It's pretty short and cute
04/11/2019, 17:30 - Apratim Mukherjee: Do you have tf.nn activations anywhere
04/11/2019, 17:31 - Jenit Jain: I'm using Keras and in that I'm giving activations
04/11/2019, 17:31 - Apratim Mukherjee: Wb concat
04/11/2019, 17:31 - Apratim Mukherjee: Are you using it anywhere
04/11/2019, 17:32 - Jenit Jain: Repeatvector I'm using
04/11/2019, 17:33 - Apratim Mukherjee: Which tf version are you using
04/11/2019, 17:35 - Apratim Mukherjee: Could try rolling back the version
04/11/2019, 17:36 - Jenit Jain: I'm running it on Collab anyway
04/11/2019, 17:36 - Jenit Jain: Which version to use
04/11/2019, 17:37 - Apratim Mukherjee: Any previous version
04/11/2019, 17:38 - Jenit Jain: Cool I'll check something thanks
04/11/2019, 17:43 - Apratim Mukherjee: 1.16 or sumthn
04/11/2019, 17:45 - Apratim Mukherjee: Actually no
04/11/2019, 17:45 - Apratim Mukherjee: Try downgrading all the way to 1
04/11/2019, 17:45 - Apratim Mukherjee: Error might be because of an activation preceded by a concat tho apparently
04/11/2019, 17:46 - Jenit Jain: Mind explaining
04/11/2019, 17:49 - Apratim Mukherjee: Idk man I googled they said iz vug
04/11/2019, 17:49 - Apratim Mukherjee: *bug
