14/09/2019, 23:44 - Jenit Jain: From the case study along with the ideas shared in the
video lectures, I learned that digital and analog modes
have their own individual advantages and
disadvantages which have to be considered separately
before proceeding further in marketing analysis.

When it comes to requirements such as affordability,
visibility, conversability, and trackability, the digital
becomes dominant and has an upper hand over the
analog whereas when it comes to requirements such as
sociability, tangibility, excitability, and anonymity, analog
has its resistance over the digital.

For credit unions such as UICCU, which are member
owned not-for-profit cooperative institutions providing a
safe place to save and borrow money at reasonable
rates, it is also important to understand the requirement
of keeping themselves updated with time and
technology to stay relevant and maximize marketing
efforts for a greater reach by utilizing the digital
advancements to the fullest possible.
14/09/2019, 23:45 - Jenit Jain: According to me, the major factors that have made
money so easy to digitize are its core features such as:

1. Overall Convenience:
The ease of conducting financial transactions is
probably the biggest motivator to go cashless or digital.
We will no longer need to carry bundles of cash, plastic
cards, or queue up at ATM withdrawal centers. Now, we
have the freedom to transact whenever and wherever
we want. Moreover, there is no more requirement of
physical presence to conduct a transaction in the world
of digital transactions.

2. Tracking your spending:
If all our transactions are on record, it becomes very
easy for us to keep track of our spending. These
records can not only help us in assisting for filing tax
returns but also guide us for efficient and effective
budgeting.

3. Lower at risk:
If money was stolen from an account, it is easy to block
a credit card or mobile wallet remotely. Besides, its
futuristic technological advancements which may
evolve to use of biometric identity such as fingerprints
of the cardholder, it can be extremely difficult to fraud,
making it a very safe option

In a broader sense, it can be concluded that overall
ease in digitalization of money was due to the
implementation of a customer-centric strategy
14/09/2019, 23:58 - Jenit Jain: AMAZON-https://www.amazon.in/

15/09/2019, 00:43 - Jenit Jain: The average fan seems to be an alumni or localite of a
nearby town. They are in the 35-40 range, married
aggressive Facebook users. They are enthusiastic in
their support of the group and put up support
messages for the Illinii. A strong Facebook campaign
should do the job
15/09/2019, 00:44 - Jenit Jain: The targetted user is an 18-21 year old male student of
Illinois university housed around campus. Being a
student the income level of the user sits at roughly 10
20k dollars a year assuming part time work at minimum
wage along with some pocket money potentially. The
target market is fitness and sports oriented sports
crowd. Highly social people. Extroversion as a trait
observed. The new 99 dollar product is a major respite
to a cash strapped student audience and should drive
participation which will drive interest and further
demand for other products. Competition is in the firm of
sports bars, bars, local sports teams, movie theatres
and other social activities. A movie running around 10
dollars matches the cost of watching a football game
Here we rely on the more strongly social nature of
football to push through it through the comparison. A
drink a at a bar or food at a sports bar should all exceed
99 a year in value while providing a comparable
experience. Overall a focus on social lubrication should
come off productively

24/09/2019, 13:53 - Jenit Jain: Chalke jayega?
24/09/2019, 13:53 - Arav Raj: Yes
24/09/2019, 23:53 - Arav Raj: For reference to those who couldn't attend today's meeting, please note -

1. Slots for the photoshoot will be from 11 am to 5 pm. But the procession for all of us will be at the same time around 5:30pm, so that we can all dance and enjoy together. We'll have 2 DJ vehicles so that everyone can fully enjoy and there isn't much crowding.

2. You even have the option of playing the dhol before your slot or for your section. But since no outsider (non MITian) will be allowed in campus, we suggest you convince your juniors as soon as possible to learn how to play the dhol.  
They won't be allowed inside the barricade though, coz that's YOUR TIME and is exclusive for the members of your section. 

3. One more thing we're worried about is that if a guard catches you drinking or undeniably drunk, they won't let you attend your own photoshoot. This is a day to remember, so make sure you actually remember it :) 

4. Ek kaafi BT cheez hai ki the PARKING LOT WILL BE CLOSED this time,coz holiday hai. Ab Jo bhi reason hai,we need to make alternatives. Mostly, we'll get another place nearby only, but  nothing is final yet. Will have to sit and think of something.

5. Our final slots for the day will be informed only 2-3 days prior to  the shoot. 

6. The names of juniors you've asked to cover the section shoot should be told to Ed Board before hand. Max 2-3 .Faaltu me us din BT nai chahiye

7. KC ya main gate, basically college ke Bahar kuch bhi scene ho, that seedha police will deal, not campus security. So we'll have to be careful there. Sab karenge but don't want to end up at the station on photoshoot day :/ 
Kuch karna ho to prior police permission ki koshish karenge

8. One more thing jispe kaafi effort daala tha was that first OFFICIAL shoot hoga, uske baad Jo bakchodi karni hai karna. But pehle Official photo leke khatam karna.

Official waale me re registered students won't be present coz batch wise chahiye for the year book. Uss ek photo ke baad, can do whatever we want.

9. If by chance there is a delay, ya koi nai aaya time pe, slot Gaya. Ek baar life me pls time pe aa jaana warna fir regret karte rahoge.

10. Nothing should be brought inside the barricade, megaphones, colour bomb,confetti  etc.. shaanti se photo ho jaaye, then hadd mazze karenge

11. Dress code to sabko pata hi hai... Suits for boys and sarees for girls.
Boys, please wear proper ties, if you think you can pull off a bow tie...... Think again..

12. NO PHYSICAL FIGHTING. 

13. Those who want to do a flash mob, get the music in a pen drive. We'll have some time between the end of photoshoot and start of procession. üëØüèª‚Äç‚ôÄ 

14. Every class will have 15 mins for the main photoshoot.

15. Frisking bahut hogi, so soch sambhal ke....

16. So many teachers jinse revenge Lena hai... But.... 7th sem mein back nai chahiye üôà so faculty pics on banners are a NO NO, or chanting and targeting a particular faculty. Dept personally le leta hai

17. Because parking lot will be closed, vehicles bhi kahin aur park karni padegi.

This is Sayani, 21 years-old, 3rd year, MIT. 

*I got molested at EDGE by the bouncer who's supposed to PROTECT us.*

It's 2 AM at night and I'm typing this 'cause I had to tell this to every student (girls esp) who go out at night, *thinking it's safe in Manipal*. Like a normal Friday, we went outside to party at *EDGE* (all of my friends are from MAHE and legally old enough to party). There was this random guy from SOC (mostly), who was trying to hit on me and my friend asked him to back out. We were a group of 8, both of them got into a fight but were successfully taken apart by our friends. 

Five minutes after, *everything was normal till the bouncer and a localite came to interfere*, mostly 'cause of the girl (Kiran-SOC, 3rd year), the guy's friend, who might have called the bouncer.

They dragged my guy friends out, hurt them, so bad that *one of them is in KMC trauma right now, getting diagnosed if he got his hand fractured*. He has cut marks on his neck which speaks about how badly he was pulled out.

I've often been to Edge, which newly got popular among students, after it changed it's name from Tito's to what it is called now. *Social media, they say, helped it gain it's popularity, and tonight I'm seeking social media to see if it gets me justice for what happened to me*. 

So, 5 minutes after the incident was sorted, the bouncer was hitting my friend, we were trying to stop the bouncer but he didn't just stop, he instead hit me and my other 2 girl friends as well, leave apart guys. I was trying to talk and narrate them what the actual incident was but they hit me back; *that was not the end*, *not once, not twice, not thrice, the bouncer and the localite guy, touched my breasts, squeezed them, and did every possible thing to just feel my private parts in the name of hitting or putting me aside*.

I knew the *manager (Rathan)*, told him about the incident, he came outside acting like he is going to help, but all that he had to say was, *"I'm trying to help you and I'm on your side but I know the bouncer, he is my 'brother', he can't do this"*. 

There was this other shopkeeper who owns a shop under Janani Lodge and maybe he is related to Edge too, he came out to sort the matter and spoke to me but all that he had to say was that *"please don't create a scene, we'll sort it out, but please don't shout, the cops will come"*.
 
*That is all that I wanted, the cops to come*. I wanted to go to the police station but my 'sensible' friends stopped me 'cause they wanted me to do everything with the help of the administration. With all faith in it, I called a friend of mine who is a part of *student support centre*, and then later the president spoke to me.

Tomorrow, I'll go to talk to the Director, I don't know what actions will be taken. There are so many things happening in and around the campus, don't know how these will stop but I really want students to know where they are going and where they think they are actually safe.

It's 2.43 AM, I'm still typing and re-reading and re-correcting this message, my friend is still undergoing his X-Ray at KMC and got 3 pain-killer injections. 

A bouncer who is supposed to protect us and help us, was someone who hit us, molested me, hit me and came on me once he was asked to apologize, despite being told that we'll call the cops. They just told, "you call the cops, we will call ten such cops".

*How unsafe are we students here?* It's not something we're unaware of that students go out to party in Manipal, but what happened to me tonight, I wouldn't want any girl to face that. I'll try my best to shut down Edge.

I recollect crying to the manager about the incident, but all that he had to say was, *"we are with you but we're sure our bouncer didn't do anything"*.

No matter what a girl is, sober/high, *she can still identify what a wrong and what a right touch is*. And there were witnesses too, to the incident. 

I don't know how any of you will help me through it, but I had to share this so that you guys don't go through what I went through tonight.

*I was mad, I was angry, I was helpless, I was crying but I knew what I wanted, I wanted to shut down a place which is not responsible for it's staff, which is not SAFE for us.* 

*I used to think Manipal is the safest place I can ever be, but I'm so sorry to myself for thinking so*.

I'm sure if there weren't others interfering, they would have made sure I ended up with at least a few broken bones and majorly, a broken dignity.

All I plead to you is to share this, *SPAM this* and make sure no one ever goes through this again. PLEASE.

*#ShutDownEdge*
