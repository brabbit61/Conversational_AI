08/07/2019, 11:29 - Vidushi Kothari: No one likes me
08/07/2019, 11:30 - Jenit Jain: Vidushi mere liye it was so inappropriate. Woh ladka uske birthday par usko messages bhej Raha hai saying youre my diamond blah blah
08/07/2019, 11:30 - Vidushi Kothari: Den I asked wat about divya
08/07/2019, 11:30 - Vidushi Kothari: She said only she talks
08/07/2019, 11:30 - Jenit Jain: Divya talks properly. Dikshita doesn't give bhav to the girls because she thinks it's too much effort
08/07/2019, 11:31 - Jenit Jain: She's distancing herself from the people who love her. And crying because people who don't care about her don't talk to her
08/07/2019, 11:31 - Vidushi Kothari: Oh okay
08/07/2019, 11:31 - Vidushi Kothari: Oh ..
08/07/2019, 11:31 - Jenit Jain: Pranjal cares for her true. But the other guys in the class stopped talking to her because they chose pranjal over her after the thing
08/07/2019, 11:31 - Vidushi Kothari: Ohkay I understood dat
08/07/2019, 11:32 - Jenit Jain: She blames me for the other guys as well
08/07/2019, 11:32 - Vidushi Kothari: Oh
08/07/2019, 11:32 - Vidushi Kothari: Yaa I know
08/07/2019, 11:33 - Vidushi Kothari: Dikshu is completely opposite of wat I am
08/07/2019, 11:33 - Vidushi Kothari: A lot of discussion happened about u
08/07/2019, 11:33 - Vidushi Kothari: And I told her u really love her
08/07/2019, 11:33 - Jenit Jain: When
08/07/2019, 11:33 - Jenit Jain: She said all this only no?
08/07/2019, 11:33 - Vidushi Kothari: Dats all was the conclusion when mom I and dikshu went out
08/07/2019, 11:33 - Vidushi Kothari: However she was in 2 minds at dat time
08/07/2019, 11:34 - Jenit Jain: What about me being insecure Wala part
08/07/2019, 11:34 - Vidushi Kothari: Den she may have taken a decision
08/07/2019, 11:34 - Vidushi Kothari: Yes she said u r very insecure
08/07/2019, 11:34 - Vidushi Kothari: However she shall do wat she wants she said
08/07/2019, 11:35 - Vidushi Kothari: She loves u but she can't take all dis all the time .
08/07/2019, 11:35 - Jenit Jain: Vidushi but you know shes too naive no.
08/07/2019, 11:35 - Jenit Jain: She says that he takes all my guy friends away without telling the reason why.
08/07/2019, 11:35 - Jenit Jain: Did she tell you about saurak and parth and how she wants to reconcile with them?
08/07/2019, 11:36 - Vidushi Kothari: No no
08/07/2019, 11:36 - Vidushi Kothari: Idk
08/07/2019, 11:36 - Vidushi Kothari: How was it in Delhi
08/07/2019, 11:36 - Vidushi Kothari: I thought u ppl were enjoying der
08/07/2019, 11:36 - Vidushi Kothari: And u had plans
08/07/2019, 11:36 - Vidushi Kothari: She said u r going clubbing
08/07/2019, 11:37 - Jenit Jain: Okay you didn't hear this from me. But it is very necessary that you know that. Saurak and parth were the people who could have helped her when she got molested. And they didn't do shit and moreover they kinda chose the molester over her. So I told them to stay away from dikshita and me. And dikshita is like they didnt do anything and I don't make friends to want something in return hence I want to talk to them
08/07/2019, 11:38 - Jenit Jain: If as a bf I can't protect her from such people then what good am I. And I'm getting the bossy bf name because I told her to not talk to such people! How is that fair
08/07/2019, 11:38 - Vidushi Kothari: Idk when and how she got molested and by whom
08/07/2019, 11:38 - Jenit Jain: I couldn't go there. Worst decision of my life.
08/07/2019, 11:38 - Vidushi Kothari: My parents have no clue as well
08/07/2019, 11:39 - Jenit Jain: This was 4th semester.
08/07/2019, 11:39 - Jenit Jain: She doesn't like to talk about it.
08/07/2019, 11:39 - Vidushi Kothari: Oh god she was really waiting for u
08/07/2019, 11:39 - Vidushi Kothari: She told me about it
08/07/2019, 11:39 - Jenit Jain: I curse myself everyday. I really should have gone.

08/07/2019, 11:42 - Jenit Jain: Dikshita was sleeping at my place when her German exam was there. I left Manipal so she was in my room. That night saurak and anirudh got drunk. Saurak went to his room and passed out and anirudh went to my room when dikshita was sleeping and grabbed her butt. Luckily she got up kicked him and ran into the bathroom and that was that.
08/07/2019, 11:42 - Jenit Jain: Still after this incident saurak and parth didn't do shit to stand for dikshita and dikshita wants to make up to them
