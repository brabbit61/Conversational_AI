13/03/2019, 16:12 - Riti Sanghvi: Hey. I reviewed his CT. As there is intra articular nature of fracture, which is not reduced on plaster. He will require surgery in the form of most probably K wires.

13/03/2019, 16:15 - Jenit Jain: 0
13/03/2019, 16:16 - Riti Sanghvi: Arey but it is not going to heal with a plaster re
13/03/2019, 16:16 - Jenit Jain: What slab was he saying then
13/03/2019, 16:16 - Riti Sanghvi: Those are really fine bones which won't heal well even if there is plaster for a good amount
13/03/2019, 16:16 - Riti Sanghvi: Your doctor?
13/03/2019, 16:16 - Riti Sanghvi: Of time^

13/03/2019, 16:21 - Riti Sanghvi: See this is what this guy told me and the other junior doctor also told me the same thing so I really do think that your doctor after meeting the HOD is going to ask you to get operated

06/11/2019, 18:37 - Jenit Jain: Hi
06/11/2019, 18:38 - Jenit Jain: So how bad is it if you don't get a skin graft
06/11/2019, 18:50 - Riti Sanghvi: What did you do to require a skin graft?ðŸ™ˆ
06/11/2019, 18:50 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
06/11/2019, 18:51 - Jenit Jain: None is fine but the skin was kinda smashed between scooter handle and auto
06/11/2019, 18:51 - Jenit Jain: Bone*
06/11/2019, 18:52 - Riti Sanghvi: If the doc told you to get a skin graft and if you don't you it will leave the wound open and could heal slowly
06/11/2019, 18:52 - Riti Sanghvi: Or infection
06/11/2019, 18:52 - Riti Sanghvi: But I am not sure why you would require skin grafting for this
06/11/2019, 18:52 - Riti Sanghvi: What did the doc say?
06/11/2019, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Ill send a pic
06/11/2019, 18:56 - Jenit Jain: Getting sutures now loo
06/11/2019, 19:15 - Riti Sanghvi: Okayy
06/11/2019, 19:53 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
06/11/2019, 20:03 - Riti Sanghvi: Okay that looks deep
06/11/2019, 20:04 - Riti Sanghvi: But it's a small patch so not sure if it would require a graft ha
06/11/2019, 20:04 - Jenit Jain: Bhaiiiiiiii
06/11/2019, 20:04 - Riti Sanghvi: But could definitely leave a scarðŸ™ˆ
06/11/2019, 20:05 - Riti Sanghvi: Whattt
06/11/2019, 20:05 - Jenit Jain: Bc fucking interns
06/11/2019, 20:05 - Jenit Jain: So the chick had a crush on her senior

06/11/2019, 20:05 - Riti Sanghvi: I am hopefully going to be one too next yearðŸ˜‚
06/11/2019, 20:05 - Jenit Jain: Much karna AATA hai nahi
06/11/2019, 20:05 - Riti Sanghvi: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ that never ends well
06/11/2019, 20:06 - Jenit Jain: Dude she took the suture and kabka
06/11/2019, 20:06 - Riti Sanghvi: Did that intern tell you skin graft laga na padegaðŸ˜‚
06/11/2019, 20:06 - Jenit Jain: Shoved it in my bone
06/11/2019, 20:06 - Jenit Jain: And anaesthesia also she gave
06/11/2019, 20:07 - Riti Sanghvi: Also were you like high or something when you were riding the activa?
06/11/2019, 20:07 - Jenit Jain: No bro. I wasn't even going to hospital. But then I applied ice on the bloody area and blacked out in the restaurant where I was washing hands ðŸ™ˆ
06/11/2019, 20:08 - Riti Sanghvi: ðŸ™ˆ Oh god why would you not go to the hospital
06/11/2019, 20:08 - Riti Sanghvi: Your right hand is for sure jinxed ha
06/11/2019, 20:08 - Jenit Jain: And in her second time, she was pulling the wire and it came out from the other end
06/11/2019, 20:08 - Jenit Jain: And last try, Puri skin hi nikal di. Instead of 2 they gave only one suture
06/11/2019, 20:09 - Riti Sanghvi: Okay that image is horrifying
06/11/2019, 20:09 - Riti Sanghvi: But just keep it clean ha it's thoda deep
06/11/2019, 20:09 - Riti Sanghvi: Mostly toh graft and all itne chote wound k liye nahi chaiye
06/11/2019, 20:16 - Jenit Jain: But like is it compulsory compulsory
06/11/2019, 20:20 - Riti Sanghvi: No re it's generally for large burns and huge ulcers and stuff where the skin wouldn't grow back easily
06/11/2019, 20:21 - Riti Sanghvi: Plus it's done under general anaesthesia so just for this much it's highly unlikely
06/11/2019, 20:22 - Jenit Jain: Besttt
06/11/2019, 20:23 - Jenit Jain: An intern here was like if it gets infected and spreads then amputation???
06/11/2019, 20:23 - Jenit Jain: I was like dafuq
06/11/2019, 20:25 - Riti Sanghvi: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
06/11/2019, 20:25 - Riti Sanghvi: That's a very remote possibility but ya do keep it clean
06/11/2019, 20:25 - Riti Sanghvi: Did they give any ointment or antibiotics?
06/11/2019, 20:25 - Jenit Jain: Hamesha right hand yaaa
