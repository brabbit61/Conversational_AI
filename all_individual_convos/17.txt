19/10/2019, 22:54 - Jenit Jain: Damn and dcc?
20/10/2019, 04:41 - Arusha Ellias: Now 🌝
20/10/2019, 05:10 - Jenit Jain: Gg
20/10/2019, 05:42 - Arusha Ellias: How's it going fam
20/10/2019, 08:17 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:17 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:18 - Arusha Ellias: What's going on
20/10/2019, 08:28 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:38 - Jenit Jain: So what's happening in fig a is that after wxa there's a rxa in p2, and we know that rxa will always follow wxa so that's why there's an arrow. 
Then wxb follows rxa, so rxb in p3 follows wxb. But rxa in p4 is independent of the other processes so we can say it's getting it's value from p1's wxa. And the rxb in p4 can follow.  But there's nothing for rxa in p3 because after rxb in p3, we know rxa can't happen (since x=b not a)
20/10/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: And in the figb,
Since there is no reading between writes in p1 and p2 we can say they are happening concurrently
20/10/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: Hence p4 first a and then b
20/10/2019, 08:39 - Jenit Jain: And p3 first reads b then a
20/10/2019, 08:40 - Jenit Jain: Hence figb is casually consistent and a isnt
20/10/2019, 08:43 - Arusha Ellias: So basically you can read from whatever process you want
20/10/2019, 08:43 - Arusha Ellias: Provided you're following the order in your process
20/10/2019, 08:50 - Jenit Jain: Yes
20/10/2019, 08:54 - Arusha Ellias: In monotonic reads you have to show the propogation
20/10/2019, 08:55 - Jenit Jain: Bro I barely remember the chapter that I studied. Send ss otherwise you're just using words I have heard of but don't remember
20/10/2019, 08:55 - Arusha Ellias: <Media omitted>
20/10/2019, 08:57 - Jenit Jain: In fig a the wsx1 is acknowledged in p2 while wsx2
20/10/2019, 08:58 - Arusha Ellias: Ha so you have to show the propagation no?
20/10/2019, 08:58 - Jenit Jain: Draw arrows everywhere bro :p
20/10/2019, 22:05 - Arusha Ellias: How's it going fam

21/01/2020, 22:49 - Jenit Jain: Anushka trust me distance is not anproblem for me. Like sharing wise. If I want to share something I will do it even when you're in office or wherever because I know you care
21/01/2020, 22:49 - Jenit Jain: Sometimes all I need is for you to talk or someone to talk
21/01/2020, 22:49 - Jenit Jain: To me
21/01/2020, 22:49 - Jenit Jain: And that's why I fucking wait for your daily adventure stories
21/01/2020, 22:49 - Jenit Jain: And if you don't give me that when I need it you know I'm not going to be normal after that.

21/01/2020, 22:50 - Jenit Jain: Yeah she doesn't know it's this. She said something along these lines so I just sent this one message as a reply
21/01/2020, 22:51 - Arusha Ellias: What

22/01/2020, 09:29 - Arusha Ellias: Then have a normal convo
22/01/2020, 09:29 - Arusha Ellias: Ask her about her day or wtv y'all talk about
22/01/2020, 09:40 - Jenit Jain: Arre the reason I said this is because she said she can't talk about her chilling when she knows something is bothering men
22/01/2020, 09:40 - Jenit Jain: So clearly I can't have a normal convo with her
22/01/2020, 14:33 - Arusha Ellias: Wait did you or did you not tell her this
22/01/2020, 14:33 - Arusha Ellias: I'm still so confused
22/01/2020, 15:03 - Jenit Jain: Basically she doesn't know why I was cribbing to you that day
22/01/2020, 15:04 - Jenit Jain: But k told her it happens with every girl I'm with and that's why I wanna change it myself
22/01/2020, 15:04 - Jenit Jain: But what she took from this was that oh it's about me so you tell me otherwise fo

25/01/2020, 10:38 - Jenit Jain: Am
25/01/2020, 10:38 - Jenit Jain: The conclusion basically was that I have to just lower my expectations :)
25/01/2020, 10:44 - Jenit Jain: Like literally this only 😂
25/01/2020, 10:46 - Jenit Jain: She was just trying to say like she actually doesn't text much and how when she shared that oh sorry for not texting with sidhant he was like yeah I understand. Bc that dude understands everything or keeps saying this, it's pissing off.
25/01/2020, 10:47 - Jenit Jain: Anushka gets too serious about changes like moving to Paris have to take the city in completely and all. Yeah that's fine but sometimes just be a normal person living in a city and chill out. "Nahi I have to be alone and get to know myself more and bs"
25/01/2020, 10:47 - Jenit Jain: Theek hai Matlab at least the fight is done.

25/01/2020, 10:58 - Arusha Ellias: As in? What's not okay?
25/01/2020, 10:58 - Jenit Jain: You see how you're associating us? Idk she associates ecen this much
25/01/2020, 10:59 - Jenit Jain: So she's selfish this way
25/01/2020, 10:59 - Jenit Jain: Forgets the people she's leaving back
25/01/2020, 10:59 - Arusha Ellias: Jenit don't overthink this so much
25/01/2020, 11:00 - Arusha Ellias: Did you tell her everything
25/01/2020, 11:00 - Arusha Ellias: You need to be talking to her about this if you feel this way
25/01/2020, 11:00 - Arusha Ellias: No point just keeping it to yourself
25/01/2020, 11:01 - Jenit Jain: I spoke about jt
25/01/2020, 11:02 - Jenit Jain: She herself said that she can't date because she's selfish
25/01/2020, 11:03 - Jenit Jain: And I'm the person who was with 10 manipal people but when she calls, I answered because ik people want to talk to her and the other way round
25/01/2020, 11:03 - Arusha Ellias: What do you want to do
25/01/2020, 11:12 - Jenit Jain: Lower my expectations :)
25/01/2020, 11:12 - Jenit Jain: Probably put my dick in some local vagina

29/03/2020, 17:48 - Jenit Jain: No so when I know that friendships are ending, and when I finally stop caring, I like to extend the ending toxicity because I kinda like it?
29/03/2020, 17:49 - Arusha Ellias: Oh like you don't want to be friends also?
29/03/2020, 17:49 - Jenit Jain: I don't know It feels good to be fought for after you've sacrified so much for nothing. Kinda payback
29/03/2020, 17:49 - Jenit Jain: Arre I can't be friends in long term with people that are so volatile
29/03/2020, 17:50 - Arusha Ellias: Then cut it off w her

29/03/2020, 17:50 - Jenit Jain: Arre why do you think I'm not "over it"
29/03/2020, 17:51 - Jenit Jain: Like fucking yesterday only I was texting rudhran
29/03/2020, 17:51 - Arusha Ellias: I've cut a lot of people off in my life not new to that
29/03/2020, 17:51 - Arusha Ellias: Rn neither of y'all are if you guys still double text each other
29/03/2020, 17:51 - Jenit Jain: I'm sure if a druggy can find some time in his reality to text back then a "oh bro I'm so stoned" girl can too
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Arusha Ellias: I'm telling you, the way this entire sem has gone
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Jenit Jain: Okay you need to get one thing straight is that we never dated xD
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Arusha Ellias: My perspective of her has completely changed
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Jenit Jain: Why tho?
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Jenit Jain: Because you got close to her and found out real her?
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Arusha Ellias: And I'm not the first person to say that in our group
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Jenit Jain: 😂cos sameeee
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Arusha Ellias: Bro I didn't think she'd cut all of us out of her life like that lmao
29/03/2020, 17:52 - Arusha Ellias: Esp you
29/03/2020, 17:53 - Arusha Ellias: Like bro we've all gone on "experiences" or wtv
29/03/2020, 17:53 - Jenit Jain: I mean sarthak did say oh she doesn't text anyone or call except Siddhant
29/03/2020, 17:53 - Arusha Ellias: This part of her reminds me a bit of sampada
29/03/2020, 17:53 - Arusha Ellias: She has v need based relationships
29/03/2020, 17:53 - Arusha Ellias: Relationships as in friendships included
29/03/2020, 17:53 - Arusha Ellias: And I hate that
29/03/2020, 17:53 - Jenit Jain: So she'll just keep how much ever indian factor she NEEDS and the rest are like "oh they are tih there only"
29/03/2020, 17:54 - Jenit Jain: Yaya
29/03/2020, 17:54 - Arusha Ellias: Even sidhant said the same thing
29/03/2020, 17:54 - Arusha Ellias: Idt they spoke that much either
29/03/2020, 17:54 - Jenit Jain: No after me and Anushka stopped properly talking mid Feb then she shifted to the next indian dude available
29/03/2020, 17:55 - Arusha Ellias: 🤦🏽‍♀️
29/03/2020, 17:55 - Arusha Ellias: In manipal even he said he didn't speak to her that much
29/03/2020, 17:57 - Jenit Jain: Bs
29/03/2020, 17:58 - Jenit Jain: Dude you know what irritates me. I have a very good judge of character so I know whom  I won't like in the long run anyway but sidhant I just can't figure out
29/03/2020, 17:59 - Arusha Ellias: Ik I'd never be close to sidhant
29/03/2020, 17:59 - Arusha Ellias: Like it'll always be a let's drink/get high/play cod kinda friendship
29/03/2020, 17:59 - Jenit Jain: Exactly
29/03/2020, 17:59 - Arusha Ellias: See
29/03/2020, 17:59 - Arusha Ellias: You and I both know you can't be mean to her
29/03/2020, 18:00 - Arusha Ellias: And I'm not saying you should or shouldn't
29/03/2020, 18:00 - Arusha Ellias: Have your fun tell her wtv you want
29/03/2020, 18:00 - Jenit Jain: Like in this entire group the first person I started trusting was rev because I've seen her at her low (rudhran) so at least I know she's real real
29/03/2020, 18:00 - Jenit Jain: Such bad advice you're giving
29/03/2020, 18:00 - Arusha Ellias: But I think you need to straight up tell her that whatever happened last 3 months was not okay
29/03/2020, 18:00 - Arusha Ellias: And you don't see her like that anymore and there's no scene of you guys going back to what y'all had in December
29/03/2020, 18:00 - Arusha Ellias: 😂😂
29/03/2020, 18:01 - Jenit Jain: But she gave me a heads up so....

01/04/2020, 09:55 - Jenit Jain: One thing dikshita said that was hurtfully honest in Bangalore was that even though towards the end the love wasnt exactly there, we were together because it had become a routine since legit first month of college.
