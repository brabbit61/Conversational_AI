This bastard who wasn't even playing comes from behind and hits me on my head, and does a John Cena ka "you can't see me" thingy and runs away. An hostelite hai toh waha pe uske dost the sab mawali so I couldn't do anything. Sab ne bola complain likh de toh I did it but I regret not being able to hit him. Tu mere jaga hota toh Kya karta?
