09/12/2018, 10:10 - Jenit Jain: Hey Naveen,
I recently emailed you regarding my internship certificate. I haven't received a reply yet. Please respond at the earliest.
09/12/2018, 16:57 - Jenit Jain: Are you seriously going to be this unprofessional?
09/12/2018, 17:05 - Naveen Singh: You should not tell me about professionalism, be thankful I have not written to your college about you unprofessional conduct at work including but not limited to bringing marijuana infused brownies
09/12/2018, 17:06 - Naveen Singh: I will make sure that it definitely goes to in printed format to your future employer
09/12/2018, 17:33 - Jenit Jain: I can't figure your fixation on not giving out a certificate, it's much easier for even your end to be done with this. While you writing to an employer or my university could be mildly disturbing, consumption in India isn't a crime, only possession is. Karnataka police won't investigate your case, Maharashtra police will find nothing on me here. But when that happens, why are you under the assumption that no one will hear about what goes down in the office, how you're all a part of the practice and you're just looking for something to pin me down with. Do you want to get investigated for distribution of narcotics in a work-place? Do you even have a legal department to represent you? Nobody coerced you into getting high neither did anyone bring brownies to your office against your will, as per Indian Contract Law 1872, you're an accomplice in this setting and more liable than I am being the business owner. Save your business, avoid an investigation, send me my certificate so we don't have to do this again. It's just easier this way.
09/12/2018, 17:36 - Jenit Jain: And trust me, I'm not blackmailing and neither should you. It's just that we can be done with this matter in a matter of minutes.
09/12/2018, 17:37 - Jenit Jain: It's very juvenile for a business owner to stress themselves with problems that aren't even theirs
09/12/2018, 17:53 - Naveen Singh: I cannot care less, you were unprofessional with your behaviour at work and last time you spoke you were just saying things for which you should get lesson for, and I am not talking about any legalities here, I cannot care less about your existence but if you want me to give a certificate I can write about your conduct there. You are just an insignificant person who should get a lesson in life.
09/12/2018, 18:14 - Jenit Jain: Speaking about unprofessional behavior, weren't you gonna treat the interns with your "very green stuff" that you got from North? And weren't you disappointed on missing that night out. And if I can recollect correctly, didn't Mohit go high for a meeting ? Maybe nothing would have happened if such behavior wasn't being encouraged by the co-founder himself
09/12/2018, 18:15 - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
09/12/2018, 18:46 - Naveen Singh: Sure, keep this for when you have to show it to your employers, I am not writing anything good in your certificate
09/12/2018, 18:46 - Naveen Singh: You need a job lol
09/12/2018, 18:46 - Naveen Singh: Should have thought about this before opening your mouth
09/12/2018, 18:55 - Naveen Singh: Also the more you annoy me with your text worse for you
09/12/2018, 18:55 - Naveen Singh: Talk to Abhisek regarding it
24/12/2018, 16:46 - Jenit Jain: Okay let's get facts clear.
I hadn't done anything but respect you as a boss till the very end.
I wasn't aware of the money crunch y'all were having. It's just that Rohan, who left less than a week before I did, got both, his certificate and money way before me. And that's the only reason I kept asking you for those things.
You could have given me a definite date but you failed to do so which led me to ask you for the things that I deserve three times.
I think me asking you for the money three times riled you up, which then pushed you to start insulting me over the slack channel. I hadn't done anything wrong except ask for a goddamn certificate and a paycheck. You weren't fair in the way you treated me as compared to Rohan. 
The only reason I started attacking you was because you started removing your frustration on me. 
You should be able to own up to your mistakes by providing me the certificate and I'll own up to everything I've said in return. 
Let's please just end this childish feud in a systematic manner.
24/12/2018, 16:47 - Jenit Jain: PS: I've never been intoxicated *at* work.
24/12/2018, 16:49 - Naveen Singh: Okay so i can remove that line and add some more remarks to help your future employer, and i was really busy with a lot of stuff and i didn't insult or made any remark to you, you were very mean and you get what you deserver for it. Take it as a lesson and know how to behave next time.
24/12/2018, 16:50 - Naveen Singh: `You weren't fair in the way you treated me as compared to Rohan. ` that's your opinion, i have never discriminated
24/12/2018, 16:50 - Naveen Singh: You should be able to own up to your mistakes by providing me the certificate and I'll own up to everything I've said in return
24/12/2018, 16:50 - Naveen Singh: ^ i have given you the certificate
24/12/2018, 16:50 - Naveen Singh: abhisek sent it to you
24/12/2018, 16:51 - Naveen Singh: and also your friend is telling me about my financial status, really do you expect to get anything aftet that
24/12/2018, 16:51 - Jenit Jain: Not on the job, I'm talking about the events that took place after our internships got over
24/12/2018, 16:51 - Naveen Singh: If i get a message again from you trust me it will not be good for you
24/12/2018, 16:51 - Naveen Singh: Because of your ill manners
24/12/2018, 16:52 - Jenit Jain: You started texting me on slack saying that you're worthless and what not and you programs don't work even though I briefed you on the entire thing.
24/12/2018, 16:52 - Naveen Singh: You have got your certificate and we have on camera you getting brownies and making everyone eat
24/12/2018, 16:52 - Naveen Singh: I never said worthless to you but what you did on internship
24/12/2018, 16:52 - Jenit Jain: Everyone wanted to have them and no one knew a source
24/12/2018, 16:52 - Naveen Singh: it did not work as expected multiple times
24/12/2018, 16:53 - Naveen Singh: Not my problem and everyone else not like you
24/12/2018, 16:53 - Jenit Jain: You also have the screenshot of you bribing your interns with thc for increased productivity
24/12/2018, 16:53 - Naveen Singh: okay cool
24/12/2018, 16:53 - Naveen Singh: show it to your employers as defence
24/12/2018, 16:53 - Jenit Jain: Man I didn't do jack shit except just ask for my things.
24/12/2018, 16:53 - Naveen Singh: i don't need a job you do my friend
24/12/2018, 16:54 - Naveen Singh: Really
24/12/2018, 16:54 - Naveen Singh: do you remember talking about statistics
24/12/2018, 16:54 - Jenit Jain: Why do you want to include the legalities
24/12/2018, 16:54 - Jenit Jain: No sorry I don't.
24/12/2018, 16:54 - Naveen Singh: Then it is even worse
24/12/2018, 16:54 - Naveen Singh: You deserve this even more
24/12/2018, 16:55 - Naveen Singh: You have your certificate and stipend paid
24/12/2018, 16:55 - Jenit Jain: Naveen let's just forget this bullshit. We both have other important things to do. Can we just end this on peaceful terms that won't cause harm to any party
24/12/2018, 16:55 - Naveen Singh: Please don't bother me
24/12/2018, 16:55 - Jenit Jain: Are you really serious about that bullshit of a certificate you gave me
24/12/2018, 16:55 - Naveen Singh: You should have thought about it when you said that startups like us shutdown and what now
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Naveen Singh: Yes 100%
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Naveen Singh: you don't decide the certificate
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Jenit Jain: You started insulting me which is the reason I said all that
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Naveen Singh: And there is jackshit you can do about it
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Jenit Jain: Everyone in the company knows that I love what physiz did
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Naveen Singh: I did not insult you at all
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Jenit Jain: Look around you and ask anyone
24/12/2018, 16:56 - Naveen Singh: I said what you did was worthless
24/12/2018, 16:57 - Naveen Singh: and you were telling me statistics about startups
24/12/2018, 16:57 - Jenit Jain: You are basically attacking me since it wasn't worthless.
24/12/2018, 16:57 - Naveen Singh: No it did not work, it may have some worth otherwise
24/12/2018, 16:57 - Naveen Singh: but lets end it here
24/12/2018, 16:58 - Jenit Jain: I haven't denied anything you've said because I know everything I said. You own up to everything you've said and then we can take the next step to a systematic conclusion
24/12/2018, 16:58 - Naveen Singh: You are not going to get anything and learn this lesson in life
24/12/2018, 16:58 - Naveen Singh: All the best, have a great future!
24/12/2018, 16:59 - Naveen Singh: The conclusion is you have your certificate which we were obliged to give and you don't get to decided what goes inside certificate
24/12/2018, 16:59 - Jenit Jain: Everything is a lie
24/12/2018, 16:59 - Naveen Singh: Till now you were giving threats and had a tone of so much aggression and also asked your friend to talk shit to me
24/12/2018, 16:59 - Jenit Jain: Which voids the certificate
24/12/2018, 16:59 - Naveen Singh: that's your opinion
24/12/2018, 17:00 - Jenit Jain: Give me proof for every line and I'll leave you alone.
24/12/2018, 17:00 - Naveen Singh: Why should i give YOU a proof
24/12/2018, 17:00 - Naveen Singh: you were hired not otherwise
24/12/2018, 17:00 - Naveen Singh: your code is in dums and is not being used

24/12/2018, 17:01 - Jenit Jain: Since I'm receiving the certificate
24/12/2018, 17:01 - Naveen Singh: This attitude is not helping you
24/12/2018, 17:01 - Jenit Jain: And I deserve the certificate which reflects me

28/12/2018, 15:45 - Jenit Jain: Since IAESTE require proof of everything on the CV, I'd like you to include the facts that I worked on models for crop classification and detection, disease detection and integration of the models to the webpage (worked with Rohan using Flask for this). Do you approve?

Jenit mainly worked on developing models for the detection and classification of various crops and diseases by deploying several machine learning algorithms. He was also a part of the development team responsible for the integration of the models with the webpage. 

We found him to be technically sound and hard-working during his tenure with us.

We wish him every success in his life and career.
