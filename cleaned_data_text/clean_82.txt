User 1: permission to redo the lab . hard copy will be sent to the dept and they didn't specify when which is why i sent you pdf first . ma'am i have class till one thousand, one hundred and thirty today . is it fine if i directly go to lab to repeat cd lab eight
User 2: ok
User 1: ma'am i have found volunteers . where should i submit their information . and i already repeated the lab on saturday, do i still need to come tomorrow for lab ?
User 2: you should submit their information to associate director academics and hod
User 1: year, reg id and name right ?
User 2: i am not very sure of it  .
User 1: okay thank you . ma'am is there no way that i can get a subject teacher to write my paper . the cd paper was very easy yet i'm getting single digit because soc people have no idea about what i'm saying . drawing one automata took forty-five mins which is also wrong since the writer messed up a little . lenient marking please ma'am  . i didn't have time to attempt the 2nd automata only
User 2: oh . but the subject teacher is not permitted to become a writer . talk to associate director, academics regarding this once
User 1: can i ask him if i can at least code on the laptop
User 2: u may ask but he might not agree . but you try requesting him once
User 1: thank you ma'am
User 2: 5,6,7 full . 8th it's flex and bison complete
User 1: thank you maam
