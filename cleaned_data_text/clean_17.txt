User 1: yes dude thanks a lot. i really mean it. but if there is no clear direction then i don't want to embarrass myself or be a liability. like thank you so much. cos last time during the internship when they gave me too much responsibility, you know how bitter it became. and i don't know enough to start a new direction in such a big company thanks a lot tho  like i'm sorry i'm not trying to be rude  you let me know when the december iaeste offers come out. i'm going by hook or by crook i still regret belarus also, thanks again 
User 2: hahahaha relax  it's a small family business only but yeah i get it, it's kinda old so they've got their own methods and my dad really wants to change it up but it's difficult because their way has been working well for so long
User 1: small business and house at nepeansea road????
User 2: he keeps trying to get me to intern there but idk how much scope there is if nothing is defined
User 1: dude i asked my dad he had data for me to work on because i'm sure they record stuff and he's like wut?
User 1: exactly and we don't know jack shit to overhaul an entire business in two months 
User 2: parents are the worst to work with tbh yeah, bigger companies with proper internship programs are best for us even in tunisia they had really high expectations i felt so bad
User 1: i feel there is minimum gpa criteria for people who do this. and i got an e in evs so na. not happening what's you mean?
User 2: but they were super understanding like they taught me a lot and they didn't really get anything out of it lol yup evs is the single most defining subject we've had giving gre this summer? there are a lot of offers out rn some are for this year and a few are for 8th sem when they send those mails check it out but be careful before committing for 8th sem because of on campus placements and all
User 1: i'm giving toefl and ielts. not sure if i should give gre again purely because i don't want to english so much. yeah man. need on campus placement. otherwise truly fucked  which companies did you select?
User 2:  i think i'll give it later this year or next summer toefl is damn chill i gave it really fucking hungover lol  zs and ugam, they both come late for data analyst portfolios you?
User 1: give it off this year only man. don't delay so much how much did you get  dude first i applied for the job profiles j wanted then i selected the companies with the max package last year, after placements they released a sheet with all the packages info. it was apparently damn secretive and stuff. harshit was like don't spread it and all
User 2: one hundred and ten  ha same but then i looked at who comes last lol also i didn't wanna both with i companies as pc bother no time to prepare only for gre 
User 1: is it good?    i might have to give it again as well. i'm dreading it
User 2: yeah most unis require 100 cutoffs they don't care about how much you get out of one hundred and twenty it's damn chill 7th grade english you've already given it no?
User 1: yeah but i just got one hundred and fifty-two in verbal. so kinda need to improve that maybe broo you need to watch kota factory on youtube most relatable stuff for us because we did coaching in jc. it'll give you a major tb
User 2: how was math kota factory wtf  how did you study english?
User 1: one hundred and sixty-eight lel vocab flash cards and books

User 1: gg
User 2: how's it going fam what's going on
User 1: so what's happening in fig a is that after wxa there's a rxa in p2, and we know that rxa will always follow wxa so that's why there's an arrow. and in the figb, hence p4 first a and then b and p3 first reads b then a hence figb is casually consistent and a isnt
User 2: so basically you can read from whatever process you want provided you're following the order in your process
User 1: yes
User 2: in monotonic reads you have to show the propogation
User 1: bro i barely remember the chapter that i studied. send ss otherwise you're just using words i have heard of but don't remember in fig a the wsx1 is acknowledged in p2 while wsx2

User 2: cuz men are weak what middle ground? bro don't do that honestly manipal is v different only everyone lives w you or max thirty buck auto ride away
User 1: anything that includes doesn't include exclusiveness when we are in different cities because thats what is the best for both of us. but yeah i've grown too close to her
User 2: and y'all are both okay with that so what? open relationship? or just not defining it?
User 1: this doubt it but haven't spoken about it no man i don't want this shit like wtf how white do you think we are  idk how okay she's with not being exclusive. because i'm thinking about her adventures in paris more than mine in blore. like she shouldn't miss out on anything lol hows jains job hunt going
User 2:  haan as long as you're both okay with it i wouldn't be able to tbh know that they might be booking up w someone else but also i wouldn't be able to end it so idk don't ask me for advice on this shit you're more experienced than me  yeah i get it what did she say about this whole exclusive thing make it clear that it's not about you wanting to fk around in blore though  he got something on the other side of blore but he's more interested in this other company they said they'll let him know by 4th but we're all meeting in kannur on 3rd for rev's sisters engagement na like ten of us are going so at least i'll see him there, he's going to blore from there to network and find acco and shit i really don't know what he's doing

User 2: she started crying? you're such a bitch 
User 1: arre that intense discussion thing
User 2: where did y'all sesh
User 1: brownies ate and then arcade like we did :') accha is it fine if anushka also comes for the divij thing if we decide to go there for a bit?
User 2: haan but they're collecting money for booze and all message divij he was only asking about y'all
User 1: yeah anushka is really confusing me because sh thinks divij doesn't like her because if nigam blah blah i'm to tired to discuss about that but bro, start from your birthday things got tooo lit for me starting with me finding out that my mom smoked the stash that she confiscated from me :) lot to catch up on
User 2: what  thats bs you want me to talk to her? you know he was the one who invited you parv and anushka for diwali and he told me to tell y'all about nye too
User 1: no wait
User 2: no one was calling their own friends like only common ppl
User 1: man she's too confused. i have a backup plan ready for lonavala because i feel she's too flakey for her nye plan
User 2: that's why they didn't call nikita and tib and all
User 1: oh damn
User 2: v exclusive suresh mess lunch 
User 1: bro i like pearl gang what should i say  fucking beautiful day don't gotta ruin it like this like she's already flaked one night out plan. so i'm just seeing how this one goes.
User 2: bro i was so fucked  tanishqa called me and yelled at me cuz i almost missed her diwali scene yeah we're v cute and degenerate
User 1: you passed out woke up and came again. long ass day.
User 2: changed out of that fkn lengha man
User 1: sure cancelled the wrong part
User 2: on 1st y'all come to soch w me no i need to buy a lengha for this kannur thing now such a bt
User 1: you think we'll have the energy. we'll do everything only in the am as soon as it's pm i'mma pass outttt
User 2: ha done pls don't bounce to powai also yk a lot of pearl people don't like arushi na
User 1: bro im never driving there again so dw about that
User 2: that's why she's come to the 5bhk once  why what happened 
User 1: what about her scene with divij bro you have to take tunnels and go through mountains can't sorry that really not mumbai
User 2: bro i got involved in their shit once i'm done  take it from me i love goss more than the next person but not worth it
User 1:  that's embedded in our bombay blood truuu bro anushka is just thinking too much that oh they don't like me or i didn't get an invitation bs. half of them will be drunk like the last one hundred and nine times they've been drunk with us in manipal so idk what's the big deal mannnn aise toh she didn't mind staying over during the vaibhav phase ufff
User 2: exactly  don't overthink so much it's pearl people baba big hearts, bigger drinking capacities and if this was true between the seventeen of us we wouldn't talk to anyone or each other for that matter 
User 1: i know man so she's on a set-up kinda date that she was assured isnt a date let her come from that  she's said oh she wants a properl invitation because the divij probably doesn't like her and then ahuja finally asked her and then she was fine man this drama is the reason i can't date so many extra things
User 2: arre after so long why does she need an invite plus it's not free it's 3k  he's telling me to send it to my school friends  what with whom? who set her up lol?
User 1: rationalising with girls is something im not good at so her bestfriend who is also in town is like oh he's my friend from college he just shifted here so entertain him. and then she fucking bounced for mood indigo. and anushka isn't even leaving the powai area. and according to the best friend this is definitely not a set up. like my asss but eh might as well get used to cheating. that's what two thousand and nineteen taught me lol
User 2: why isn't best friend with them who bounced to mood i? the two of them?
User 1: exactly what i dont understand only the bestfriend they are roaming around on a date 
User 2: seems more my type than hers, intro? where did these two go
User 1: text her
User 2: two birds one stone 
User 1: havent gotten a reply since two hours lol
User 2: but don't overthink so much baba
User 1: yeah i'm chill only
User 2: triv cares about you
User 1: how's the travellinngggg
User 2: but you know the only way to stop this is to either make yourself completely okay with it somehow or have the whole exclusive talk
User 1: i don't want her to have that restriction so i'm def not doing that this 
User 2: at least for now till paris
User 1: oh that we've had so that's why i'm chill
User 2: i mean i'm sure trivedi won't do anything but at least for peace of mind oh y'all are exclusive till paris?
User 1: yes are you waiting for jain to decide a job and then y'all will have the exclusive talk or is he in bangalore for sure?
User 2: we've been exclusive for a long time now  had the talk in august i only brought it up but in both our heads it was already kinda exclusive
User 1: yeah but he's def in bangalore?
User 2: but after the rishabh thing i was not taking any chances lmao
User 1: yeah same case lol
User 2: the other talk is yet to happen
User 1:  ewwwww

User 2: neither of us have been in anything this serious in the last three years ew what's that why that title tho
User 1: which is why i don't want to start one with us starting the relationship only with long distance. it just doesn't make sense at all. because it's edgy and it's bollywood duh tomato pav some masala and more tomato ah man. i hope they are the best in town.
