User 2: kya sensitive, it's like the most generic live story problem ever aur kisi ko kya be bahenchod ghar me baat thi bas mera ek ek cheez pata rehta hai tujhe it's literally like family abhi tak uss baat pe randi rona
User 1: kya bolu bata. try kar kar ke chuur hogaya hu
User 2: chorh de bhai try karna.
User 1: sab bato par sorry randi rona hai. no good reason
User 2: self respect sabse upar hai i can understand what place you're in aur aisa hona andar se is normal rn just leave the conversation with her, turn around, walk away it'll fuvk you up
User 1: na bhai. koi self respect nahi chaiye. i'm in that phase
User 2: like literally very badly chahiye mai bol raha hu jenit
User 1: that's over ik but nahi manta mun
User 2: plus jab dekhega usko lautega toh it'll fuck you up more. par jenit abhi persevere kar ja please
User 1: bhai interview season kaisa jayega pata nahi
User 2: she'll probably go and fuvk around. i'm sorry but she will, but jab dikhega ki tere tarah izzat se koi nahi rakhta, gaand fategi uski
User 1: that's the thing she won't even fuck around. shes just going to stay in her room and be a loner
User 2: jaega. har cheez ek part hota hai zindagi ka, ek kharab part ko dusre part ko affect mat karne do
User 1: bola na mai ki kshitij also told her that he has a crush on her
User 2: that's just bullshit. i know even you're not that naive to believe that who the fuck is kshitij? ex?
User 1: tera kshitij
User 2: mera kshitij? bc kaun? kshitij bhargaw
User 1: tiwari
User 2: ?
User 1: abbe eee
User 2: uski maa ka bhosa madarchod randi ka bacha saala bhpsadiwala
User 1: kal uske saath 2:30am baat kari for thirty mins and i'm like i know y'all didn't talk about college and shit matlab andar se puri maa chodni hai
User 2: usko nikale hum madarchod localite chaaku ghopne wale the bc apne risk pe nikala usko uski toh mai aaj gaand maarta hu madarchod, abhi ek hafte me aaunga usko, ghutna pe baetha k sorry nahi bolwaya tere se mera naam kaustubh nahi ye bahenchod ko dikshita jo bhi batayi, usme mera naam use kiya ek baar bhi?
User 1: tera name sirf pranjal ke saath aya. dikshita hated the fact that i took muscle with me.
User 2: what muscle? wtf it's all fat notice nahi kiya usne dude everyone goes with one of their friends , all of your friends just happen to be large and dominating except harshit  who the fuck is pranjal
User 1: guy we threatened
User 2: oh yes sorru and anirudh is that guy right who molested her ye bc itna liberal leftists hona bahut galat hai. everything is not solved by itself
User 1: yes
User 2: sometimes you have to step in
User 1: samjha samjha ke takh gaya
User 2: and that's not intruding each others life, especially when you guys were practically in live in
User 1: bc uski behen see bhi lad liya
User 2: now why did you do that usko sorry bol apne side kar, explain karo kya chutiya ladka hai tu there was no need of that last two texts chup chap sorry bol and tell her, she doesn't realize how much you love her sister and what she means to you. and all of that emotional crap and tell her to understand this and talk to her make her believe you're a nice guy
User 1: i'm blocked do can't really do that
User 2: gg really need to figure this out rn you are looking like a desperate, illogical crazy dude which honestly you're not and idk why she's looking at you like that
User 1: she's too preoccupied with her fun in kolkata and hence she's saying most of it. i don't believe she didn't want to be physical.
User 2: that's just bullshit.
User 1: beech mai friend ke saath bhand hui and they spoke about me a lot.
User 2: that's one of the things they say to piss you off
User 1: time will persevere it's just that i have to learn to be patient
User 2: dekh bhai ek baat bolunga
User 1: bhai itna hurt bahut zyada time se nahi hua
User 2: iska bhi apna ek alag maza hai launde. kismat waalo ko milta hai, trust me ek baat bolunga dekh mera three saal ka relationship kabhi hua nahi ki mere ko pata hoga ki kitna dard me hai tu, lekin hai kam time k relationship me aisa hua hai, toh kuch nahi toh chaliye 70-80 percent samajh sakta hu mai. toh i can understand kis level pe hai abhi tu ek baat meri maan le, baaki mat maniyo self respect aur tera career, tujge define karte hai, what type of person you are and how strong you are. lekin ye do cheez teri hai, and you don't owe them to anyone so next semester jo bhi ho, i'm mostly not gonna be there, promise me you'll keep these intact dekh mai nahi kar paya aur itna hagg doya 14lakh aur four saal k lesson de raha hu woh bhi bas ek part hai life ka zindagi nahi.
User 1: job toh full effort jayega rest all i can say is i'm going to try my best
User 2: sun na
User 1: i know
User 2: sometimes
User 1: but like rn it's just a blur
User 2: it's better not to try let time do it's thing
User 1: bhai nahi hota hai haar ha
User 2: para hai
User 1: i'm counting on it
User 2: pata lekin jitna push karega try karega, utna chidhegi, utna hi dimag me negative thoughts aur staunch honge once you shut up and let her be dimag khaali hoga pehle fir apne aap sochegi this will either bring her back, or make her move on, and tbh, both are equally good option trust me do your thing, daaru p, gaanja fook, 18lac ka placement le, and ignore any or every text or call she send or make except if it is to get back simple kabir singh nahi hai zindagi
User 1: i'll do this
User 2: two lac my commission from eighteen 18lac 
User 1: ok

User 2: a23 pavitra ja k mera bag le. just call me when you go there pavitra pahuch k call karna you'll probably need to take one more person with you 2 at least cars to carry alcohol and shitz.
User 1: bhai bhejte reh love you appreciate
User 2: add few portable speakers or just open up. the doors and play music in the car but you're gonna need cars. at least 2. zyada hoga toh dikkat nahi this is all that's required. rest tum log kitna lit and creative ho uspe depend karta hai have you had the posters made?
User 1: working in it
User 2: chutiya go to sheffins under eot
User 1: cool
User 2: they'll hook you up for cheap or go to dots beside black cup both are cheap, good and fast rest, find out if college is providing dj or not. if not, y'all gonna need that too after you exit the campus after photoshoot this, you're gonna need few sober people around. and don't think you'll handle it. trust me, have some sober dickheads around. it will help just in case cops drop by, which honestly isn't a possibility.
User 1: pakka nahi ayegem ?
User 2: rest, try to be creative. you cse snowflakes are a disappointment when it comes to partyin like that nahi aaenge and that's why i said you're gonna need car and few sober guys around you can never be too careful with anything. if you have them, then you can just shut the trunk door and say, i'm just transporting it. no public drinking
