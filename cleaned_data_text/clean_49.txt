User 1: hey, did you solve the question you sent on the group ? the simd one
User 2: yup
User 1: can you please send the solution :) . how'd you get n as twenty-five
User 2: oh wait . i was answering some other question . ignore that . so i assumed it's the illiac four network . it's the simplest design for one pe connected to four others . and we need r which is root n . and only n twenty-five has a proper square root
User 1: isnt there some formula 2n-1 for the number pes one pe  is connected to
User 2: um in which topic
User 1: wait . this is in barrel shifter
User 2: well illiac routing functions satisfies the condition as well
User 1: the question has only simd so how do we know which network to select ?
User 2: aren't they all simd
User 1: exactly
User 2: like we only deal with the pes . and there are multiple pes . so i think both work if they satisfy it . like you have make a barrel shifter network within those constraints . mesh network is just easier . afaik most did mesh
User 1: alright . thankss
User 2: welcome  . hey do we have replacement ysis in the syllabus ?
User 1: i'm eefm ? . in . never heard of it
User 2: nothing nothing i got confused
User 1: all the best
User 2: thanks  . uh . what do you mean
User 1: like how did they get the associated cost
