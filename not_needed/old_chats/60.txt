9/29/18, 10:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Whyd you deactivate your insta

9/29/18, 11:23 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell me
9/29/18, 11:44 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: Eh it's just a bunch of self destructive thoughts which leads to the conclusion that I'm a horrible person
9/29/18, 11:45 PM - Jenit Jain: Did someone tell you something
9/29/18, 11:50 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: Nope, not really
9/30/18, 12:09 AM - Jenit Jain: Vidit already told me
9/30/18, 12:10 AM - Jenit Jain: Tell me when you feel like talking
9/30/18, 12:10 AM - Jenit Jain: I'm here :)
9/30/18, 12:10 AM - Priyanka Sahoo: It's not really related to that
9/30/18, 12:11 AM - Priyanka Sahoo: I just feel like I'm not important to some people whom I thought cared about me
9/30/18, 12:11 AM - Jenit Jain: Then telll
9/30/18, 3:41 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: Thought you should know that mahima and saba are going to confront me about something tonight
9/30/18, 4:41 PM - Jenit Jain: Do you know why
9/30/18, 4:49 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: Mahima - maybe because of the misconception that I told vidit that she *wanted* to hook up w someone that night at big shot. but I only said that cause i was ranting to him about what saba had told me the morning after my drunk night and it was all related in that context. And I think he took it out of proportion and thought she was hooking up w someone and confronted her about it. there's a clear cut difference between _wanting_ to hook up and actually hooking up with someone
9/30/18, 4:49 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: I have no idea what saba wants to talk about though
10/1/18, 12:39 AM - Jenit Jain: So what Happened
10/1/18, 1:00 AM - Priyanka Sahoo: We sorted stuff out - it's all good now

4/20/19, 3:46 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: I dont feel like hanging with them ever again
4/20/19, 3:46 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't go
4/20/19, 3:46 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: they want me to pay for it but why should I pay when the damage was mostly done by them?
4/20/19, 3:47 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: like, I literally contributed to the mess by 1%
4/20/19, 3:47 PM - Jenit Jain: They puked on the bed as well right?
4/20/19, 3:47 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: yeah
4/20/19, 3:47 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: jeet walked on the bed with shoes on
4/20/19, 3:47 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: made the bed very dirty
4/20/19, 3:47 PM - Jenit Jain: Harshit was really pissed when he came home
4/20/19, 3:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Just tell me properly
4/20/19, 3:48 PM - Jenit Jain: Who all fucked which part of the room
4/20/19, 3:48 PM - Jenit Jain: We'll try to intervene if we can
4/20/19, 3:48 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: only priyank and jeet made the mess dude
4/20/19, 3:48 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: no one did anything
4/20/19, 3:48 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: everyone else was sitting and chilling
4/20/19, 3:48 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: priyank smashed the cake on jeet's face
4/20/19, 3:49 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: so the cake was literally everywhere on the floor, on the walls, on the curtains
4/20/19, 3:49 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: then jeet walked all over the bed with those dirty shoes on
4/20/19, 3:49 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: puked in the washroom and on the bed
4/20/19, 3:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Sure?
4/20/19, 3:49 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: 100%
4/20/19, 3:50 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: nobody else even threw cake on jeet besides priyank
4/20/19, 3:50 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: I was just sitting on one corner of the bed and it happened
4/20/19, 3:50 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: <Media omitted>
4/20/19, 3:51 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: there was no need to point it out like that
4/20/19, 3:52 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: I'm not paying for this shiz
4/20/19, 3:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Sont
4/20/19, 3:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Exactly
4/20/19, 3:52 PM - Jenit Jain: This is why he doesn't get girls
4/20/19, 3:53 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: he legit has no shame
4/20/19, 3:53 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: apparently he told sasha that he'll call me up and tell me to pay
4/20/19, 3:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Balls
4/20/19, 3:54 PM - Jenit Jain: See it's jeets birthday today so I personally don't want to get into it today. But if harshit wakes up and says so what we need to talk this out, then we'll go up today itself
4/20/19, 3:54 PM - Jenit Jain: If he calls you and tells you to pay, just blast him off
4/20/19, 3:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Don't get pressurized
4/20/19, 3:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell him y'all didn't do shit and the bill would be 36k without your presence as well
4/20/19, 3:55 PM - Jenit Jain: And he should be ashamed because only he fucked up
4/20/19, 3:55 PM - Jenit Jain: And hang up
4/20/19, 3:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Pretty much what we're gonna sau
4/20/19, 3:56 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: legit but dude, doesnt he have any decency? üôÑ
4/20/19, 3:56 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: I thought I'd just ignore his call
4/20/19, 3:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Or this
4/20/19, 3:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell Sasha to tell Priyank then that you're not paying
4/20/19, 3:59 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: yeahh, sasha mentioned that he'll talk to priyank
4/20/19, 3:59 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: this entire situation is just awks
4/20/19, 4:00 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: on top of that, how does he expect us to pay for the damage when jeet and priyank made the mess?
4/20/19, 4:00 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: he was like "I dont think its right for one person to pay the entire due"
4/20/19, 4:01 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: if the others went crazy and made the mess, then it makes sense
4/20/19, 4:11 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm going to talk to raghav about this too
4/20/19, 4:11 PM - Jenit Jain: Dw I'll leave you out of it

4/21/19, 10:48 AM - Jenit Jain: We want to know if Priyank actually told Sasha to call you
4/21/19, 10:48 AM - Jenit Jain: You deleted this message
4/21/19, 10:48 AM - Jenit Jain: So when he does and pressurizes you then we'll go
4/21/19, 12:44 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: sasha did call me yesterday but he told me to pay for the wine, shisha and the non smoking charges; I told him I'm not paying for the non smoking charges coz its not like I knew they booked a non smoking room
4/21/19, 12:45 PM - Jenit Jain: How much for the smoking
4/21/19, 12:45 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: not sure, but he asked to pay 1k
4/21/19, 12:45 PM - Priyanka Sahoo: including the non smoking
