8/8/19, 6:39 PM - Anjali Mit: How are you handling this
8/8/19, 6:39 PM - Anjali Mit: Not with breaking hands pls ffs
8/8/19, 7:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Done
8/8/19, 7:30 PM - Jenit Jain: I've never felt purer or cleaner. She was very toxic for me without me knowing it and fair enough my mistake. But now I know. I've realised that she confused her love with attention. Whoever gives the most attention wins. 3 years I gave. And then the ex started few months back I guess. I knew their fucking pubg wasn't just pubg. And then she liked that attention better. And now in this semester, she is using that pranjal guys attention to satisfy her need to fulfill ego. Divya shouted at her saying that dikshita you need to let that guy move on and not lead him on and she said that she doesn't want to stop talking to him. She confessed to me that she'd rather let her pranjal and kshitij be lead on than me. And I realised that I wasted 3 years behind a shithead like her but it's fine it was a good journey and j learned a lot and j matured a lot. Fuck them cheaters. I'm happy and at peace
