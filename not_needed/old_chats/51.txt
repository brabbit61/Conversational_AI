"Listen I need to apologize for my behaviour. I know it's not right of me to demand you not to see him. It's my mistake that I should've realized and I regret it. But as your boyfriend, it is right of me to ask you to refrain from talking to this person. I might come off as insecure right now but it's only because I love You and I don't want to lose you. I completely respect whatever decision you make."
