10/30/18, 11:07 PM - Jenit Jain: Can we ping from any pc to x.com or only from the other router
10/30/18, 11:15 PM - Vishwa Cs: If you want a PC to use the DNS server you have to use a special command
10/30/18, 11:15 PM - Vishwa Cs: From the PC type 
ip dns (address of dns server)
10/30/18, 11:16 PM - Vishwa Cs: And set up routing tables between routers
10/30/18, 11:18 PM - Jenit Jain: Can you just do ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.2 in router 1
10/30/18, 11:19 PM - Vishwa Cs: Wait im trying this question. I'll tell you if I get it
10/30/18, 11:20 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks
10/30/18, 11:25 PM - Vishwa Cs: Okay so
10/30/18, 11:25 PM - Vishwa Cs: In R2 im doing 
ip host x.com 30.0.0.2
10/30/18, 11:25 PM - Vishwa Cs: Now from that I set up routing tables in R1 and R2
10/30/18, 11:26 PM - Vishwa Cs: R2 is 
10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.1
10/30/18, 11:26 PM - Vishwa Cs: And R1 is 
30.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 20.0.0.2
10/30/18, 11:26 PM - Vishwa Cs: And then set up dns normallt
10/30/18, 11:28 PM - Jenit Jain: Yeah this is was asking
10/30/18, 11:28 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks
10/30/18, 11:28 PM - Vishwa Cs: Then in PC1 type 
ip dns 20.0.0.2 
ping x.com
10/30/18, 11:28 PM - Vishwa Cs: It'll work after that
10/30/18, 11:30 PM - Jenit Jain: What's the first command
10/30/18, 11:31 PM - Vishwa Cs: It's a command to let the PC know that the DNS Server is 20.0.0.1
10/30/18, 11:31 PM - Vishwa Cs: Otherwise the ping command won't work
10/30/18, 11:31 PM - Vishwa Cs: You'll get "cannot resolve x.com"
10/30/18, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: First we do ip 10.0.0.2 255.0.0.0 10.0.0.1 right
10/30/18, 11:31 PM - Jenit Jain: 1 or 2
10/30/18, 11:32 PM - Vishwa Cs: PC1
10/30/18, 11:32 PM - Vishwa Cs: I've basically made x.com = PC2
10/30/18, 11:32 PM - Jenit Jain: No 20.0.0.1 or 20.0.0.2
10/30/18, 11:32 PM - Vishwa Cs: So you're trying to ping pc2 via x.com
10/30/18, 11:32 PM - Vishwa Cs: Oh sorry
10/30/18, 11:32 PM - Vishwa Cs: 29.0.0.2
10/30/18, 11:32 PM - Vishwa Cs: 20.0.0.2*
10/30/18, 11:33 PM - Jenit Jain: .
10/30/18, 11:33 PM - Vishwa Cs: What is this command?
10/30/18, 11:33 PM - Jenit Jain: To set the IP of the computer
10/30/18, 11:34 PM - Vishwa Cs: PC1
ip 10.0.0.2/8 10.0.0.1
10/30/18, 11:34 PM - Jenit Jain: Yep
10/30/18, 11:34 PM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah correct what you said
10/30/18, 11:34 PM - Jenit Jain: Cool thanks
10/31/18, 10:29 AM - Jenit Jain: How do you connect one router to 2 routers such that both can be used for dns query
10/31/18, 10:36 AM - Vishwa Cs: I'll try that now
10/31/18, 10:37 AM - Vishwa Cs: So basically two DNS servers and one client?
10/31/18, 10:38 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes
10/31/18, 10:47 AM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah so
10/31/18, 10:47 AM - Vishwa Cs: One router has two fast ethernets
10/31/18, 10:47 AM - Vishwa Cs: Each connected to a DNS server
10/31/18, 10:47 AM - Vishwa Cs: Then set up DNS servers normally
10/31/18, 10:47 AM - Vishwa Cs: And in the client just add two name-servers
10/31/18, 10:48 AM - Vishwa Cs: <Media omitted>
10/31/18, 10:52 AM - Jenit Jain: After this do we do the IP route command for both the don't servers or whag
10/31/18, 10:53 AM - Vishwa Cs: No need for route
10/31/18, 10:53 AM - Vishwa Cs: Suppose x.com is on router 1 and y.com is on router 2
10/31/18, 10:53 AM - Vishwa Cs: If you ping y.com on the client router it'll try resolving y.com on both servers
10/31/18, 10:53 AM - Vishwa Cs: And whichever replies with the IP it'll ping to that router.
10/31/18, 10:58 AM - Jenit Jain: And if there are pcs the IP dns followed by 2 ips right
10/31/18, 10:58 AM - Vishwa Cs: If there are PCs then you'll need to use ip route
10/31/18, 10:59 AM - Vishwa Cs: If you're pinging from a PC to a PC using a DNS server then you'll need to use ip dns (address of server)
10/31/18, 10:59 AM - Vishwa Cs: From the PC you're pinging from
10/31/18, 11:00 AM - Jenit Jain: In all the 3 router right
10/31/18, 11:00 AM - Jenit Jain: We'll have to put 2 addresses right
10/31/18, 11:02 AM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah
10/31/18, 11:02 AM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah type the command twice in total
10/31/18, 11:05 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
10/31/18, 11:11 AM - Vishwa Cs: Check your.interfaces
10/31/18, 11:11 AM - Vishwa Cs: If they're all up
10/31/18, 11:11 AM - Vishwa Cs: Type "show int" and see if anything it down
10/31/18, 11:11 AM - Vishwa Cs: That happened to me earlier. I forgot to do "no shut" for one of the f0 connections
10/31/18, 11:23 AM - Jenit Jain: What can be the error when icmp ttl expired error is generated
10/31/18, 11:31 AM - Vishwa Cs: Either your routing table is I'm correct or it cannot react destination
10/31/18, 11:32 AM - Vishwa Cs: Which means ip route isn't set
10/31/18, 11:33 AM - Vishwa Cs: Isn't**
10/31/18, 12:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Yo can you come early
10/31/18, 12:03 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll ask you few doubts and it'll help you clear up
10/31/18, 12:15 PM - Vishwa Cs: What time?
10/31/18, 12:17 PM - Jenit Jain: By 1245?
10/31/18, 12:19 PM - Vishwa Cs: Too early dude. Need to eat lunch and come. I can come 1:15 ish
10/31/18, 12:21 PM - Jenit Jain: Won't have enough time before exam then
11/8/18, 3:28 PM - Vishwa Cs: Dude do you have your disk scheduling code from OS lab?
11/8/18, 4:24 PM - Jenit Jain: Tell me all the codes you need
11/8/18, 4:24 PM - Jenit Jain: I'll send tbem
11/8/18, 4:25 PM - Vishwa Cs: Just disk scheduling
11/8/18, 4:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Cool

11/8/18, 7:25 PM - Vishwa Cs: Thanks
11/9/18, 8:37 AM - Jenit Jain: Let me know when I can call for 5 mins thanks
11/9/18, 9:46 AM - Vishwa Cs: Call whenever
11/21/18, 9:10 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
11/21/18, 9:10 AM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
11/21/18, 9:10 AM - Jenit Jain: All the sequence numbers are correct only rightn
11/21/18, 9:10 AM - Vishwa Cs: I dont think they are in the second diagra m
11/21/18, 9:10 AM - Vishwa Cs: ACK doesn't consume a sequence number if there's no data
11/21/18, 9:11 AM - Vishwa Cs: But SYN and SYN+ACK consume one sequence number
11/21/18, 9:12 AM - Vishwa Cs: I guess when you're writing it, mention that ACK doesn't consume a sequence number if no data is present and then base your diagram off of that
11/21/18, 9:12 AM - Jenit Jain: So it should be 8000 in the ack?
11/21/18, 9:13 AM - Jenit Jain: Does this have to be x in the last ack
11/21/18, 9:14 AM - Vishwa Cs: I think it's correct in this one.
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Jenit Jain: Cool thankss
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Vishwa Cs: Wait
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Vishwa Cs: Seq no. should be x in the last one
11/21/18, 9:15 AM - Vishwa Cs: But ACK is correct
11/21/18, 9:45 AM - Jenit Jain: And the first data also uses 8001
11/21/18, 9:45 AM - Jenit Jain: 8000 is incremented because the ack uses the 8001
11/21/18, 9:45 AM - Jenit Jain: X is not incremented because there will be no segment that can use x as a seq number as the connection is being terminated
11/21/18, 9:45 AM - Jenit Jain: So no sense making it x+1
11/21/18, 9:45 AM - Jenit Jain: This is what sir said
11/21/18, 9:46 AM - Vishwa Cs: You're assuming this segment carries data right?
11/21/18, 9:47 AM - Vishwa Cs: Otherwise if you mention that the ACK doesn't carry any data then it'll be 8000 only
11/21/18, 9:47 AM - Vishwa Cs: I remember losing marks in this for first sessional that's why I think it's 8000
11/21/18, 9:48 AM - Jenit Jain: I just spoke to sir
11/21/18, 9:48 AM - Jenit Jain: Basically he said that since we know that 8001 will be used by the first data seg, it will also be used for the last ack in the connection establishment phase
11/21/18, 9:50 AM - Vishwa Cs: Again, this is an assumption. You're assuming the last ACK will carry data and if that's the case then the sequence number is 8001. Otherwise if its ONLY and ACK being sent then the sequence number is 8000.
11/21/18, 9:50 AM - Vishwa Cs: I did this in first sessionals and he cut marks
11/21/18, 9:53 AM - Vishwa Cs: This diagram is correct
11/21/18, 9:54 AM - Jenit Jain: I don't know man. Sir just said that ack will be 8001 no matter what so I'm gonna go with that. And other sections also have been taught the same thing
11/21/18, 9:57 AM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah that's correct. ACK is 8001. The data after that will have seq 8001 also because ACK doesn't carry any data. If ACK carries data then the next data sent after ACK will have 8002
11/21/18, 10:00 AM - Jenit Jain: Yes
11/21/18, 10:01 AM - Vishwa Cs: Also is y-1 correct in the other diagram?
11/21/18, 10:02 AM - Jenit Jain: Yeah that's fien
11/21/18, 10:03 AM - Vishwa Cs: How is Sequence number going backwards?
11/21/18, 10:07 AM - Jenit Jain: The next bit expected is y but since there is no data, previous seq number can be used
11/28/18, 8:00 AM - Jenit Jain: Bro can you explain scheduler activation
11/28/18, 8:00 AM - Jenit Jain: The light weight process wala part
11/28/18, 9:46 AM - Vishwa Cs: Still need to read that subpart
11/28/18, 9:55 AM - Jenit Jain: Please let me know
11/28/18, 10:01 AM - Vishwa Cs: Okay so basically just write that everytime the kernel wants to communicate to the user thread it uses an upcall
11/28/18, 10:01 AM - Vishwa Cs: And an upcall can pass through an LWP, which is present in between the kernel thread and user thread
11/28/18, 10:01 AM - Vishwa Cs: That's all I'm learning
11/28/18, 10:17 AM - Jenit Jain: Lol
11/28/18, 10:17 AM - Jenit Jain: Okayy
11/28/18, 10:17 AM - Jenit Jain: Thanks
11/28/18, 10:19 AM - Vishwa Cs: Fuck this subject. Too much is there
11/28/18, 10:19 AM - Vishwa Cs: What all have you done from the Linux chapter?
11/28/18, 10:29 AM - Jenit Jain: What is 😂😂
11/28/18, 10:29 AM - Jenit Jain: Fuck 10 and 21
11/28/18, 10:29 AM - Vishwa Cs: 21.2 to 21.6 lol
11/28/18, 10:29 AM - Vishwa Cs: gg
12/8/18, 11:33 AM - Jenit Jain: How'd it go fam
12/8/18, 1:14 PM - Vishwa Cs: Can't even log in to SLCM so that's great
12/8/18, 1:16 PM - Vishwa Cs: You got to see yours already?
12/8/18, 1:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Yep, but just hoping it improves after 2 pm 😂
12/8/18, 1:51 PM - Vishwa Cs: Got lucky?
12/8/18, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: You think?
12/8/18, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Stuck on 8.73 for this sem
12/8/18, 1:52 PM - Vishwa Cs: That's decent only lol
12/8/18, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: OS fucking A
12/8/18, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Rest is fine
12/8/18, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: I think sahil missed 10 because of ios 😂
12/8/18, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: How was yours?
12/8/18, 1:55 PM - Vishwa Cs: 8.2
12/8/18, 1:55 PM - Vishwa Cs: Somehow got a B in CN lab??
12/8/18, 1:55 PM - Vishwa Cs: My internals were 50/6
12/8/18, 1:55 PM - Vishwa Cs: 60
12/8/18, 1:56 PM - Vishwa Cs: And I got full in the lab exam
12/8/18, 1:56 PM - Vishwa Cs: So that's 90/100 wtf
12/8/18, 1:57 PM - Jenit Jain: The OS guy wrote 90% on my end sem marksheet in front of me and still didnt get A* 😂 with 56 internals
12/8/18, 1:57 PM - Vishwa Cs: Wtf

1/17/19, 1:38 PM - Jenit Jain: I'm up for it
2/10/19, 11:15 AM - Jenit Jain: Dude I'm in for the neural networks paper
2/10/19, 11:15 AM - Jenit Jain: Let's start after sessionals?
2/10/19, 11:33 AM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah we'll start after sessional properly.
2/10/19, 11:33 AM - Vishwa Cs: We'll need to discuss a proper timeline and follow it
2/10/19, 11:34 AM - Jenit Jain: ++

3/26/19, 11:10 AM - Vishwa Cs: Lmao you see that ML paper. 2 minutes of studying is enough
3/26/19, 11:12 AM - Jenit Jain: I saw
3/26/19, 11:12 AM - Jenit Jain: F
3/26/19, 11:13 AM - Jenit Jain: Can you send the ai paper tho
3/26/19, 11:15 AM - Vishwa Cs: <Media omitted>
3/26/19, 11:15 AM - Vishwa Cs: <Media omitted>
3/26/19, 11:30 AM - Jenit Jain: ✌🏻
3/30/19, 4:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Dude is Bayesian theory Linear or non Linear
3/30/19, 4:09 PM - Jenit Jain: And in it the number of training instances per class changes the output na
3/30/19, 4:09 PM - Jenit Jain: What is this called?
3/30/19, 4:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Local something na
3/30/19, 4:09 PM - Jenit Jain: Like some technical word
3/30/19, 4:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Is it called class likelihood
3/30/19, 5:23 PM - Vishwa Cs: What we've done so far is linear only no?
3/30/19, 5:23 PM - Vishwa Cs: No idea what you're taking about
3/30/19, 5:24 PM - Vishwa Cs: Local models is there. That's chapter 12
3/30/19, 5:24 PM - Vishwa Cs: Class likelihood is P(C|x)
3/30/19, 5:24 PM - Jenit Jain: I guess this only
3/30/19, 5:25 PM - Jenit Jain: How is polynomial Linear
3/30/19, 5:25 PM - Jenit Jain: Or knn linear
3/30/19, 5:26 PM - Vishwa Cs: Polynomials where do we get in Bayesian theory?
3/30/19, 5:27 PM - Jenit Jain: No I'm saying we have done algorithms that are not linear
3/30/19, 5:27 PM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah we have. But I think Bayesian theory is linear only
3/30/19, 5:27 PM - Vishwa Cs: We have done non linear classifiers and stuff but not much
3/30/19, 5:28 PM - Vishwa Cs: Like we had a question in sessional 2 how do you classify two classes where C1 is [2,4] and C2 is everything else. This can only be done by a non linear classifiers
3/30/19, 5:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Makes sense
3/30/19, 5:31 PM - Jenit Jain: Please confirm na
3/30/19, 5:32 PM - Jenit Jain: I tried to find in the text but couldn't
3/30/19, 5:54 PM - Vishwa Cs: I can't find anything that says so
3/31/19, 6:47 AM - Jenit Jain: All existing birds can fly except 2
3/31/19, 6:47 AM - Jenit Jain: For all a bird(a) and fly (a) and (there exists x,y bird (x) and not fly (x) and bird (y) and not fly (y) and (x not equal to y)
3/31/19, 6:47 AM - Jenit Jain: Right?
3/31/19, 10:11 AM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah that's what I did in my paper. Idk if I got it right or not. Didn't see my paper yet
3/31/19, 10:11 AM - Jenit Jain: How much did you get thoq
3/31/19, 10:11 AM - Vishwa Cs: 11

4/2/19, 5:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro did you get the op
4/2/19, 10:38 PM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah I did
4/2/19, 10:38 PM - Vishwa Cs: Sorry for the late reply
4/2/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: Bt
4/2/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: I fucked up a small part
4/2/19, 10:39 PM - Jenit Jain: Was the other Cuda question hard
4/2/19, 10:42 PM - Vishwa Cs: Arey
4/2/19, 10:42 PM - Vishwa Cs: Idk the other question
4/10/19, 12:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro
4/10/19, 12:30 PM - Jenit Jain: In proof by refutation you basically just do kb ^ ~a and then at the end prove a, then say a^~a is false hence proved
4/10/19, 12:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Right?
4/10/19, 12:30 PM - Jenit Jain: And what do you do in proof by resolution?
4/10/19, 12:30 PM - Jenit Jain: Just apply the resolution formula?
4/10/19, 12:56 PM - Vishwa Cs: Idk about this
4/10/19, 12:57 PM - Vishwa Cs: Proof by resolution is basically cancelling out terms like A and ~A until you get something that is always true
4/10/19, 12:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Using the resolution formula only na
4/10/19, 12:59 PM - Vishwa Cs: Yeah the one in the book
4/11/19, 10:32 PM - Jenit Jain: bro how do you get the tokens without using spaces in the IP code
4/11/19, 10:32 PM - Jenit Jain: or are you going to do those small scams we did
4/11/19, 10:37 PM - Vishwa Cs: I'm using space separated input for RDP
4/11/19, 10:37 PM - Vishwa Cs: For symbol table I'm doing it normally only
4/11/19, 10:38 PM - Jenit Jain: which is?
4/11/19, 10:41 PM - Vishwa Cs: Like from a file
4/11/19, 10:41 PM - Vishwa Cs: Remove preprocessor
4/11/19, 10:41 PM - Vishwa Cs: Comments
4/11/19, 10:41 PM - Vishwa Cs: Then parse
4/11/19, 10:43 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay thanks
4/20/19, 4:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro can you send me pvm notes from the 4th textbook
4/20/19, 4:45 PM - Vishwa Cs: <Media omitted>
