7/27/19, 1:50 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Listen the trash is taking itself out
7/27/19, 1:50 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Don’t ruin things
7/27/19, 1:50 PM - Jenit Jain: She really just wanted to concentrate on her life and really believes that we are not right for each other
7/27/19, 1:50 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Oh so she took that long to realize
7/27/19, 1:50 PM - Aafreen Hirji: But that’s how people are
7/27/19, 1:51 PM - Jenit Jain: Exactly
7/27/19, 1:51 PM - Aafreen Hirji: They want something to just not feel that lonely and then when they think they can survive without it or they need some change they will just come up w the stupidest reason and leave

7/27/19, 1:52 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Never regret it or count it as a waste of time
7/27/19, 1:52 PM - Aafreen Hirji: It taught you things
7/27/19, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Even I'm convinced that she is not coming back so I'll try to move on and see if we can be friends down the line
7/27/19, 1:52 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes
7/27/19, 1:52 PM - Aafreen Hirji: just take the good memories and look forward to better ones
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Jenit Jain: I guess
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Honestly being friends is not a good option
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Especially when you’re the one w feelings
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Jenit Jain: Thing is it can't be worse so might as well try lok
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Like even if you have little feelings for her
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: It’s gonna be fucked up
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: To watch her move on
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Or have fun
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Or not talk to you that often
7/27/19, 1:53 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Every damn thing you’ll notice
7/27/19, 1:54 PM - Aafreen Hirji: If you’re friends w her
7/27/19, 1:54 PM - Jenit Jain: Oh I asked her today she's already moved on since she had been confused for so long
7/27/19, 1:54 PM - Jenit Jain: She just hasn't gotten rid of the routine part
7/27/19, 1:54 PM - Aafreen Hirji: Ohh so she did have this at the back of her head
7/27/19, 1:55 PM - Aafreen Hirji: You gotta do it before she does
7/27/19, 1:55 PM - Jenit Jain: It started when I threatened that guy
7/27/19, 1:55 PM - Jenit Jain: Let's see
7/27/19, 1:55 PM - Aafreen Hirji: How long ago was this?
