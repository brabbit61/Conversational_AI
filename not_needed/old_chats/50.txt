An hostelite hai toh waha pe uske dost the sab mawali so I couldn't do anything. Sab ne bola complain likh de toh I did it but I regret not being able to hit him. Tu mere jaga hota toh Kya karta?
3/29/19, 9:43 PM - Mayur: Chup

3/29/19, 9:47 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro if it keeps doing then fuck his case. Whatever happened till now you can't do anything since it happened and you didn't do anything
