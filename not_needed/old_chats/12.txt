4/6/19, 7:58 PM - Jenit Jain: 👍🏻
4/15/19, 7:10 PM - Jenit Jain: Limitations and Improvements:
The algorithm runs till only n=10 because of single GPU, Golomb's ruler for larger values of n are computed using cluster computers so we couldn't implement that, also we are using global memory in the kernel and each kernel defines an array to store the ruler which can be optimized by using shared memory. For efficient use of the GPU under heavy computation, we must run the parallelized form of the algorithm on clusters, and take advantage of the shared memory available.
4/15/19, 7:32 PM - Amrit Cs: Itna kaafi Hain?
4/15/19, 7:34 PM - Jenit Jain: It's only a small part na

4/15/19, 7:49 PM - Jenit Jain: It's fine I'll make the graphs and send
4/15/19, 7:49 PM - Jenit Jain: Just n vs time.rigjt
4/15/19, 7:49 PM - Amrit Cs: Yup I think so.
4/15/19, 8:17 PM - Jenit Jain: <Media omitted>
4/15/19, 8:17 PM - Jenit Jain: bro just crop the graph and put it in the report
4/15/19, 8:18 PM - Amrit Cs: Will do boss
