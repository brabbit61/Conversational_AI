4/4/19, 4:08 PM - Jenit Jain: How do you know which ones are free variables and how do you set their values
4/4/19, 5:24 PM - Abhilash Cs: See the last non zero row u take in echelon form right, every variable that is left there, can be taken as a free variable. Cos this gives u free values which scale the whole range 

So say suppose there is like 2 variables in the bottom-most equation, 
The equation might be 
4y+ 3z=0

Here u if take z as a free variable, u can write y as a version of y. Like y=-(3t)/4

Now in the top equations, u keep substituting these values

If the top line was 2x+3y+4z, u have taken z as t already. U derived y in form of t in the last step, now u substitute both in this equation n find x in terms of t only n were the final equation with only one variable t
4/4/19, 5:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Why did they take it y s t
4/4/19, 5:26 PM - Abhilash Cs: If the last equation in echelon for had 3 variables, u take z n y as free variables as t1 n t2 n write the first variable as the combination of these two in the equation n find it's value interns if t1 and t2.
Then u subsequently take it up the equation s substituting in values
4/4/19, 5:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Okay okay
4/4/19, 5:26 PM - Jenit Jain: And what about the random values that they have taken
4/4/19, 5:27 PM - Abhilash Cs: It is a number which can span the whole space of numbers
4/4/19, 5:27 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes that's a basis
4/4/19, 5:27 PM - Jenit Jain: But how did they assume
4/4/19, 5:27 PM - Abhilash Cs: U don't have to define, it means it can be any number in the space
4/4/19, 5:28 PM - Jenit Jain: Accha
4/4/19, 5:28 PM - Jenit Jain: So what should the last step be?
4/4/19, 5:28 PM - Jenit Jain: This should be the last step ticket
4/4/19, 5:28 PM - Jenit Jain: right*
4/4/19, 5:28 PM - Abhilash Cs: Like if a variable is a free variable, it necessarily means it belongs to R and all numbers that the given equations derive can be expressed as a linear combination of these free variables
4/4/19, 5:29 PM - Abhilash Cs: Last step is when u transfer the free variables to the first equation
4/4/19, 5:30 PM - Abhilash Cs: Cos the first equation has the highest number of variables in echelon form no
4/4/19, 5:33 PM - Jenit Jain: Yes
4/4/19, 5:33 PM - Jenit Jain: And the range of t is an image of t right
4/4/19, 5:39 PM - Abhilash Cs: Nahi nahi. No relation with that. It basically means it takes all value without restriction
4/4/19, 7:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Thanks man
4/4/19, 7:03 PM - Jenit Jain: They don't give extra time to cripples also shish
4/4/19, 7:03 PM - Jenit Jain: Our paper was way easier than yours😂
4/4/19, 7:38 PM - Abhilash Cs: 😂
4/4/19, 7:38 PM - Abhilash Cs: Damn. Compensated. Cripple😂
4/20/19, 6:13 PM - Jenit Jain: bro how much did you get in math?!
4/20/19, 6:54 PM - Abhilash Cs: 16.5
4/20/19, 7:16 PM - Jenit Jain: Man he is fucking everyone
4/20/19, 7:16 PM - Jenit Jain: And total?
4/20/19, 8:24 PM - Abhilash Cs: 33
4/20/19, 8:24 PM - Abhilash Cs: Fckd
4/20/19, 8:25 PM - Abhilash Cs: I think he's evaluated assignments out of 4
4/20/19, 8:25 PM - Abhilash Cs: How much did u gey
4/20/19, 8:26 PM - Jenit Jain: 26😂
4/20/19, 8:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Just ask him to review it again
4/20/19, 8:26 PM - Jenit Jain: Pm the guy who wrote the text on group
4/20/19, 8:28 PM - Abhilash Cs: Yeah I did
4/20/19, 8:28 PM - Abhilash Cs: But I think he's corrected it pretty seriously
4/20/19, 8:28 PM - Abhilash Cs: U r more fucked
4/20/19, 8:29 PM - Abhilash Cs: At least we got MTech people who score low
4/20/19, 8:29 PM - Abhilash Cs: I guess cut off will be lower
4/20/19, 8:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Do you know anyone more than 40
4/20/19, 8:29 PM - Jenit Jain: Counting on it man
4/20/19, 8:30 PM - Abhilash Cs: I guess manav Manoj and Siddharth got above 40. I'll ask though
4/20/19, 8:30 PM - Abhilash Cs: Most people lost marks at a sessional level only
4/20/19, 8:32 PM - Jenit Jain: I got 11.5 in assignments bro 😂
4/20/19, 8:32 PM - Abhilash Cs: Did u miss any?
4/20/19, 8:57 PM - Jenit Jain: Ya man
4/20/19, 8:59 PM - Abhilash Cs: Math OE was a disaster lol
4/20/19, 8:59 PM - Jenit Jain: Reason I took software testing 😂
4/20/19, 8:59 PM - Abhilash Cs: Dude, No😂
4/20/19, 9:06 PM - Jenit Jain: Did you take the neural nets one
4/20/19, 9:11 PM - Abhilash Cs: Yeah
4/20/19, 9:11 PM - Abhilash Cs: Soft computing
4/20/19, 9:11 PM - Abhilash Cs: I like soft computing. But I used to like linear algebra also
4/20/19, 9:12 PM - Jenit Jain: I like marks so I'll try to stick to that.😂
4/20/19, 9:12 PM - Abhilash Cs: Hard realization. Takes time to kick in
4/20/19, 9:12 PM - Abhilash Cs: I'm fucked for one more year lol
4/20/19, 9:12 PM - Jenit Jain: will need improve my cgpa after this 5-month disaster
4/20/19, 9:13 PM - Abhilash Cs: Yeah. Honeymoon semester for u😂
4/20/19, 9:14 PM - Abhilash Cs: People say it's easier to score in 7th though
4/20/19, 9:23 PM - Jenit Jain: bro I'll do eom and shit in the vacations itself
4/20/19, 9:24 PM - Jenit Jain: sahil mode on af
4/20/19, 9:28 PM - Abhilash Cs: Sahil class sunta hai. Ho payega?
4/20/19, 9:28 PM - Abhilash Cs: 😂
4/20/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: at least 1/6 classes.
4/20/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: and ill do at least 1 lab without him
4/20/19, 9:42 PM - Jenit Jain: should be enough for a 10😂
4/20/19, 10:05 PM - Abhilash Cs: There is only one lab
4/20/19, 10:05 PM - Abhilash Cs: That too web technologies
4/20/19, 10:05 PM - Abhilash Cs: Chill
4/20/19, 10:05 PM - Abhilash Cs: That's the amount of optimism I need in life atm
5/5/19, 9:40 PM - Jenit Jain: Bro do you have notes for single value decomposition
